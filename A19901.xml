            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Diocles</hi>) vntill the end of iudgement, wherein if I hee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudged to dye, neither my Lord and Father <hi>Frank-Gall,</hi> nor the hardie ſpirit of the black Knight <hi>Gallchalt,</hi> ſhall ſuffer peaceably to enioy. If I leaped downe at the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe into the lower court, it was not for conſcience of any euill deede; which hetherto I haue not committed, vppon the profe of armes with the ſworde and ſhield (for as yet I am not Knight) againſt the two brothers and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who dare preſume to charge mee with villanie: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet by flying or feare of their aſſault, for I neuer had doubt of them, as full well I haue giuen them ſince to vu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand: but onely by deſcending without ladder or frac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with my hand ſet vppon the window eaſelie going downe, to giue way and place to their furious inſolence and threatning cries, and for ſhunning of committing any act of hoſtilitie in a houſe of hoſpitalitie: and alſo becauſe I would not giue any diſhonorable ſuſpition to their ſiſter, whoſe honor if I had not had in more recommendation than they (who haue brought it in queſtion) without lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the place, I had well defended their entrie, and haue ſent them with their parents like inſenſible fooles. But hauing theſe two reſpects, I thought better to ſtake my force and hardines, and to giue place to their furie, than to fight with mine hoſtes, and giue ſcandall to their ſiſter. And if I had found no impeachment in the court, no drop of bloud had béen ſhed by me in their houſe. But you know (O iuſt
<hi>Diocles</hi>) that it is permitted, yea and neceſſarie by the righteous lawe of nature, to repulſe force by force, and violence by violence. Wherefore perceiuing my ſelfe er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from all way of flying combat, and finding my ſelfe inuironed with a mightie companie of armed men who had ſworue either my death or captiuitie (who am free and ſonne of free and liberall condition) and aſſailing mee on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie ſide without mercie or grace, I retired my ſelfe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the azile and ſacred ſtatues of the
<hi>Charites</hi> and Graces, thinking there to finde grace, franchiſe and ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.<pb n="15" facs="tcp:176416:12"/>Wherefore, if in defending my bodie, ſome ouer raſh perſons haue faine vnder my trenching ſworde, I ſay that it is not I that haue ſtaine them, for I neuer had will thereto, and the iuſt lawe dooth not iudge but volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie deedes: as for theſe, they themſelues like furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous wilde Bores haue raſhlie come to bee ſtaine, and therefore of their owne voluntarie death I pleade my ſelfe innocent. To conclude, whereas they charge mee with violence and Rape, committed on the perſon of their ſiſter: I anſwere it is ſo farre from trueth, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe their ſiſter <hi>Noëmia</hi> being by the terrible and ſauage
<hi>Centaure</hi> rauiſhed, and without hope of recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie from being euer loſt, I by valiance againſt violence haue brought her home ſafe and ſounde; and ſo reſtored her to her brothers. Whereby if it were ſo that I had ſubtracted her to mee, and appropriated her perſon to my will, yet haue I no taken, but that which ought to bee mine by good conqueſt and right of warre, for that they loſt her with ill keeping, and I got here againe from the monſterous <hi>Centaure,</hi> and therefore ſhe ſhould be mine by vniuerſall right of people. And thus concluding, for mine abſolution, I craue full deliuerance, and reſtitution of mine armes. Or otherwiſe, if I be found guiltie of death (which ſhall leſſe greeue mee after the death of my moſt deere <hi>Noëmia</hi>) moſt inſtantly I beſeech you (O Lorde <hi>Diocles,</hi> and all you the aſſiſtants) that you will cauſe that murthcring archer to bee ſought and found out, that ſo traiterouſly hath ſtaine the innocent <hi>Noëmia,</hi> and after that you haue condemned him to cruell death (as reaſon and Iuſtice require) to put him into my hands, that I may execute and take vengeance vppon him, to the ende my ſoule after her departure out of this bodie may carrie agreeable newes to the ſpirite of <hi>Noëmia,</hi> in witnes of the conſtant loue, that in her life and after her death I haue borne her. And for faithfull proofe of my wordes ſpoken and alledged in my defence: let the<pb n="16" facs="tcp:176416:13"/>domeſticall ſeruants euen vnto the torture, bee examined and aſked, who kept her companie when ſhe was rauiſhed by the
<hi>Centaure,</hi> and by mee deliuered out of his handes. Likewiſe let

            <p>The defenſe of <hi>Alector</hi> heard and vnderſtood (which ſeemed not vnreaſonable) the thoughts of the whole aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance by cloſe fauor, accorded to his abſolution and deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.

            <p>MY Lord <hi>Diocles</hi> and moſt iuſt Potentate, in whoſe preſence the moſt aſſured tremble, for reuerence of thy ſeuere iudgement, which receiueth neither<pb n="17" facs="tcp:176416:13"/>fauor, flatery, nor lying, I proteſt puerly and entierly to vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that which I know without conceale or diſſimulation. There are two moneths alreadie paſt or there abouts, that my Ladie <hi>Noëmia</hi> deceaſed (whoſe Soule reſt in peace) was ſent for by my Lady <hi>Callirhoa</hi> her couſen, to her caſtel of the <hi>Greene-head,</hi> to accompanie, &amp; paſſe the time with her certaine daies, whiles my Lord <hi>Spathas</hi> her huſband was gone twelue iournies from thence toward an Augur, beeing an ancient Hermit of a moſt ſtraite life, and a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine man, reſident about the horned rock, to inquire, and knowe of this holy man, of certaine ordinarie and almoſt daily praies and ſlaughters which were done in his lands and woods; of perſons and beaſtes either ſtaine, rauiſhed, or incurably loſt, without knowing by whome, or whether it were a Diuell, a ſauage beaſt, or a man that committed theſe outrages. For the bodies of thoſe who were found ſtaine, were ſtroken and pierced with arrowes, headed with the venemous teeth of Dragons, or elſe marked and ſtriken with round blowes without wound, which gaue ſuſpition that they were ſhot or ſtroken downe by the hand of a man. But when any man followed them who were rauiſhed, there could none other trace be founde but the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of a horſe ſo ſoone vaniſhed into the thickneſſe of the wood, that thoſe who purſewed them oftentimes found themſelues loſt.

Who interpreting the worſt, and fearing leaſt the euill ſhould fall vpon his houſe, or vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe who were there in, ſpecially on his faire Couſin <hi>Noëmia</hi> (which he coniectured to be the ſnowie <hi>Hind</hi>) on the next morning (in an euill houre) ſent vs towards <hi>Orbe.</hi> For in paſſing by the wood of Hazards, as wee rode cheerefullie one morning vnder the ſhaddow of the great leaued trees, giuing eare to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> melodious tunes of the chirping birds, we heard a great brute like the trampling of a droue of beaſtes approching vs. And ſuddainely wee perceiued a moſt horrible monſter of greatneſſe, groſenes, &amp; enormious hideur, who vnto the lower part of his belly had an humaine ſhape, rather Giantous than natural, with a great hoarie head, bruſking vp like the bruſſels of a wild Bore, with a viſage fierce, and lookes feare full, his mouth opened, diſcouering his great teeth, his bodie and armes full of veynes couered with cleere haire, not much vnlike the ſilke made of a fleeſe. And the reſt of his bodie in the forme of a great red horſe, exceeding the common bignes of other horſes, running, flinging, and leaping vpon foure horſe legs ſtrong and light, right towards vs, carying a great maſſy Club hanging at his girdle made of a greene and croked branch of haſell with his leaues, and a number of arrowes at his ſide, and a bowe in his hand, wherewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all<pb n="19" facs="tcp:176416:14"/>hee let flie an arrowe, and ſtew the horſe of <hi>Floridas,</hi> who feeling his horſe to fall vnder him, readily ſet foote on ground, and hand to his weapon to defend his faire ſiſter
<hi>Noëmia</hi> (whom he loued moſt decrely) againſt this hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible monſtrous <hi>Centaure,</hi> running foorth right to rauiſh her. Wherefore
<hi>Floridas</hi> poſtpoſing his life to the health of his ſiſter, came onely to him with his ſword. But the <hi>Centaure</hi> gnaying with diſpitefull laughter drew out his groſſe mare, and gaue him ſuch a heauie ſtroke vpon the reines, that hee brooſed all his bones, and then trode him with his horſely feete till hee brake his hart: Seeing this, wée fled, abandoning my Ladie <hi>Noëmia,</hi> whome farre of (turning our ſelues) wee ſawe rauiſhed by the <hi>Centaure;</hi> who hauing mounted her vp behinde him, was entred into the thick wood. And after her, her Damoſell <hi>Arcana</hi> run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning on foote with her haire about her eyes: for the Mule whereon ſhe was mounted, being afraide of the
<hi>Centaure</hi> (as a Mule is a phantaſticall and vmbragious beaſt) had throwne downe his charge, and by maine running, retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the Caſtle of
<hi>Greene-head</hi> from whence wée were departed. Whereupon after wee had loſt the ſight of my Ladie <hi>Noëmia;</hi> we came flying towards
<hi>Orbe</hi> to declare vnto her friends this ſorrowfull newes. And as for other things I knowe none, but that the next daie after at night we ſawe her arriue, ſafe and ſound, whom wée ſuppoſed to haue béen vtterly loſt; in the companie and conduct of a right faire Squire, whome you may behold here preſent. Who euer ſince hath remained in the houſe of the Lordes <hi>Gratians,</hi> behauing himſelfe moſt graciouſly towards all, and moſt louingly with my Ladie <hi>Noëmia;</hi> like a young Gentleman with a faire Gentlewoman. If there bee any other thing I knowe, let
<hi>Arcana</hi> be aſked, who ought to know more: for as touching my atteſtation <hi>Caleſtan</hi> can beare me witnes.</p>
            <p>Then aroſe <hi>Caleſtan</hi> affirming y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> déed to be ſo, adioyning therewithall that in flying, the Prophecie of the wiſe man
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:176416:15"/>came to his memorie to bee verified. For this monſtrous
<hi>Hippocentaure</hi> was neither man nor beaſt, but of doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtature, rauiſhing and murthering: as for the ſnowie Hinde conquered, it was
<hi>Noëmia,</hi> the Leopard (who is a beaſt, baſtard to the Lyon and the <hi>Pardatide</hi>) was <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridas</hi> the baſtard ſtaine; the two Harts did flie, being them two ſeruants <hi>Tharſides</hi> and
<hi>Caleſtan,</hi> who through feare had abandoned their dame by flight. But of the reſt of the probleme, he proteſted to vnderſtand nothing, as one not knowing the conſequent effects; whereof <hi>Arcana</hi> may bee aſked:
<hi>Arcana</hi> then at the commandement of the Iudge aroſe, and proteſting by her faith to report the trueth vpon paine of her life began as followeth.</p>
            <p>All that which <hi>Tharſides</hi> and <hi>Caleſtan</hi> haue related is according to trueth and veritie (my Lord <hi>Diocles</hi>): after whoſe flight and my Mules, I being on foote, knewe not what better to doo than by extreame dolor, which brought my deſperation of life, to runne after my Lady <hi>Noëmia,</hi> whome my ſoule could not abandane: in following the trace of the <hi>Centaure</hi> by an vnknowne way which I ſawe him hold, in crying and lamenting ſo high, that all the wood rang, &amp; the only Eccho filled mine eares, who with mee ſeemed to bewaile the miſfortune of my Ladie <hi>Noë<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia.</hi> At my hautie cries &amp; clamors in the wood, I met with a right fayre, yong and braue Eſquire (which was <hi>Alector</hi> whom you ſee preſent before you) mounted vpon a goodly Courſer, who ſeeing mee ſo to run halfe out of my witts, demaunded the cauſe of my dolor; which when he had vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtoode, he required me to conduct him to the place where I had ſeene this monſter, ſaying that he would deliuer my Lady or elſe there die the death. I comforted with this promiſe, in ſo much that I ſeemed to be as light as a hinde, ran before towards the thick of the wood, whereinto I ſawe this monſtrous <hi>Centaure</hi> enter, and the Squire followed mee a gallop: vntill at length wee perceiued the
<hi>Centaure</hi> hauing diſcharged his pray, and training her by
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:176416:15"/>force into the hollowe of a high Rock, enuironed with xv. great Okes right thick and leauie. <hi>Alector</hi> ſeeing him, cried from farre: leaue that Maiden thou byformed mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and addreſſe thy ſelfe to me, who will chaſten thee for thine outrage. The <hi>Hippocentaure</hi> hearing and ſeeing him come with bridle loſed and the ſworde in his hand, let flie at him an arrowe wherewithall hee had peirced him through if he had not been couered with his impenetrable ſhield. Wherefore fearing leaſt his horſe ſhould be ſlaine, ſet foote on ground, and adreſſed himſelfe to the monſter with merueilous hardines: whereat the
<hi>Centaure</hi> being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaſt, babled againſt him certaine barbarous and ſauage ſpeeches of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>urious threatning, and gaue him ſuch a waightie blowe with his Club, that made
<hi>Alector</hi> (who receiued it vppon his ſhield) to bowe, his knee: but haſtily getting vp againe, hee reſtored it him ſo fiercely with a blowe of his ſword, ſo rudely ſet vpon his humaine ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>h, which was his horſely ſhoulder that hee diſcouered his ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes with great dolor and effuſion of bloud: wherewith the monſter caſt foorth a crie ſo hidious that all the wood rang of it, and the wilde beaſts for feare ran to hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues; and after that lift vp his maſſie Club, and let driue a lurdie blow ſufficient to fell an Elephant. But <hi>Alector</hi> both light and nimble, eaſilie ſhunned his great ſtroake which fell in vaine, and ſo rudely, that the
<hi>Centaure</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall had his arme and hand aſtonned, ſo as with great paine could hee lift vp his maſſie Club any more. The which
<hi>Alector</hi> perceiuing, with his good ſworde cut off one of his hands hard by the ioynt, which fell to the ground with his maſſie Club, which cauled the <hi>Centaure</hi> to caſt foorth a more horrible crie than before: and ſeeing himſelfe diſarmed and diſmembred, with the feare which hee had of the ſhining ſworde of <hi>Alector,</hi> turned his hinder horſely parts, yerking out ſuch ſtrokes that the aire ſeemed to ſparkle with fire. But the valiant Eſquire prompt and quick to turne himſelfe, ſhunning alwaies the blowes; or<pb n="22" facs="tcp:176416:16"/>elſe bearing off with his ſhield the furious yerkes of his heeles, ſtroke him ouerthwart in his yerkings with ſuch a cutting blowe, that notwithſtanding the hardnes of his ſkin, and bruſkled haires, he cut a ſunder the ſinewes of his leggs euen to the diſcouerie of his bones; which as yet were whole. Which the
<hi>Centaure</hi> dolefullie feeling, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againe his face, and with great ire lept vpon <hi>Alector,</hi> thinking to haue beaten him downe with his forefeete. But the gentle Squire ſeeing ſo faire a marke, forgat not himſelfe, but with a thruſt into his horſely breaſt pierced vnto his humaine heart. And ſo this byformed monſter beeing ſtroken to death, fell downe to the earth with all his foure feete, tumbling in his black bloud, and giuing vp his laſt crie, not altogether in humaine voice, nor altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in horſly gneyng, but mixed with both, like a man gnaying, or like a horſe brutally ſpeaking, vntill ſuch time as hee was cleane dead: and at that inſtant the Heauens began ſo to powre with Lightning, Thunder, and great Raines (which as I thinke were the Diuels carying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie the ſoule of this monſter) that neceſſitie conſtrained my Ladie <hi>Noëmia</hi> and mee, at the perſwaſion and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of <hi>Alector</hi> to retire our ſelues into the hollow of the Rock which was the habitation of the
<hi>Centaure,</hi> where we entred in not without great feare, agaſt at the meruei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous combat, and of the hardines and proweſſe of the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Squire who comforted and aſſured vs right humaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And there within we found much Veniſon, and diuers fruites of the wood, which wee vſed that night for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent neceſſitie. And whiles they were eating, my Ladie
<hi>Noëmia</hi> (in whoſe heart loue had alreadie taken place by regarde and admiration of the beautic, hardines, proweſſe and graciouſnes of this yong Eſquire, whome ſhee beheld with great admiration by the light of a moſt meruailous ſcabberd of his ſworde which hee caried, ſo cleere in the night and in an obſcure place, that it gaue ſo much light as a flaming brand;) demaunded him, what good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture<pb n="23" facs="tcp:176416:16"/>had brought him ſo happelie for hir deliuerance? My faire Ladie ſaide <hi>Alector</hi> (who on his part was no leſſe attaint with the grace and beautie of
<hi>Noëmia,</hi> than ſhee of his) I knowe not well by what way I am come hether, more to my happines than your owne: but this I am certaine, that either by ſome <hi>Hyperborian</hi> winde, or ſpirite, I haue been ſince one moneth paſt, rauiſhed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Septentrionall Seas from the top of the wings of <hi>Durat Hippopotame</hi> the great ſwimming and flying horſe of my Father <hi>Franck-Gall,</hi> and carried by him ouer Lands and Seas by many iournies, to the great diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and ſorrowe of my ſaid Father, whome I knowe ſearcheth mee throughout the Worlde, vntill at length this windie ſpirite repoſed mee in a faire Garden of a Caſtle not farre from hence: where a young Damoſell like you (but not ſo faire, and ſomewhat more aged) found me, and vnderſtanding my name, mounted mee on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, vppon that condition that I ſhould followe you vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this wood, and giue you aide if you needed the ſame. For an olde Witch the ſame morning had told her, that if you were not recouered by <hi>Alector,</hi> you would be vtterly loſt. And that the firſt man which ſhee found called bv my name, ſhee ſhould without delay ſend after you. Now thus it is, that I was no ſooner repoſed in the Garden, but the Spirite who had carried mee about ſo farre, at his departure ſeemed to ſay to mee after a whiſpering manner in my left eare, entring into my braines theſe words following.
<q>
                  <l>

                  <l>Who doth thee ſeck, on lofty ſeas, ytoſt with many a wind.</l>
               </q> And thereupon entered into the Garden a right godly La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, faire, yong and of great grace, but notwithſtanding ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull, and lamenting her owne Couſen <hi>Noëmia,</hi> lately departed from the Caſtle of <hi>Greene-head,</hi> (for ſo was the place named fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence I came) for the words which the<pb n="24" facs="tcp:176416:17"/>old witch had told her. This yong dame thinking her ſelfe to be alone and vnproudied, finding me in the garden which was cloſed on euerie ſide with high walles beyond the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of a ladder, was not a little abaſhed: but after aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring her ſelfe demanded of me, who had let me in? What I was? And what I would haue. And I anſwered, I could not tell, <hi>Alector,</hi> a horſe. She hearing this name of <hi>Alector,</hi> without demanding me other thing, led me into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Eſquurie &amp; gaue me leaue to chooſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> horſe which pleaſed me beſt, vpon the foreſaid conditions. The which moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeably accepted, I choſe this faire apple grey which you ſee, (now had he becauſe of the tempeſt put his horſe vnder couert amongſt the trées, which <hi>Noëmia</hi> and I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continently knewe to bee the horſe of my Lord <hi>Spathas.</hi> And wee vnderſtoode that ſhee who ſent him after vs, was my Lady <hi>Callirhoa</hi> of the caſtle of

Thus being mounted, with leaue taken of the Ladie; I promiſed to accompliſh her commaundement. And vpon this horſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſince from that place, (for my former iournies I could neiter marke norknow, no more than the waie which the bird maketh in the aire, the ſerpent on the ground, or the ſhip on the ſea) yea on this horſe haue I been brought he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without finding any man by the waie, or creature of whome I might aſke newes of you, which I deſired to knowe: but onely that I met a little mule fearefull and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridled, which fled through the wood right towards the caſtle, who notwithſtanding at the ſight of my horſe ſtaied a little and aſked him (as I thinke) in the Caballiſtic lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage ſome newes of you. But the phantaſticall mule in his mulike ſpeech anſwered
<hi>Hynha</hi> (I know not what it is) and ſodainely departed, running with bridle abated towards the Eaſtle from whence I was come: which
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:176416:17"/>gaue me ſuſpition that ſome trouble was happened vnto you, and for that cauſe I haſted, vntill by the crie of your Gentlewoman I turned the bridle, and by her hauing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood your trouble, came preſently to your ſuccor, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh my promiſe, where I haue done mine endeuor as you your ſelfe haue ſeene.</p>
            <p>You haue done ſo much (quoth my Ladie <hi>Noëmia,</hi> who alwaies had her eyes faſtened vpon him in ſpeaking) you haue done ſo much and ſo valiently (O noble Squire, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerer of a rauiſhed maiden) that I ſhall finde my ſelfe eternally bound to you: yea I my ſelfe, my brothers, and al their <hi>Gratian</hi> familie, confeſſing for this firſt &amp; ouer little gratuitie towards you, that I haue neither in nor without me, a thing worthie and ſufficient to recompence your me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite.

And for that you alledge not to haue ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to recompence the pleaſure and ſeruice which I haue done: not for this (which I confeſſe to be little or nothing in reſpect of your dignitie) but for all the ſeruices and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors which I deſire and pretend to doo for you in time to come, and for the great and vnſpeakeable loue which I beare towards you, I require you Ladie <hi>Noëmia,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund in recompence, a little of that which aboundeth in you, that is of grace, vertue, mutuall and irreuocable loue.

            <p>The Ladie <hi>Noëmia</hi> as yet yong and ſimple, &amp; one who neuer had heard ſo much of loue, at the words of this faire yong Squire, ſound her ſelfe cleane changed, mooued, and chafed with the heares which ſhe had neuer before felt; and with trembling words anſwered him thus; My faire frend, albeit hether too I haue neuer felt nor knowen what loue ſhould be, whereof ſo much ſpeach procéedeth: neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe now (I knowe not by what newe tranſmutation) I féele my ſelf ſo changed, in flamed, and affectioned towards you, (I knowe not whether it be that which we call Loue or no) that I cannot wil but what you will: nor haue plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or contentment in other but you; yea, as though I were wholly tranſformed into you: whereby I eſtéeme it the leaſt dutie which I can or would do for you, to loue you who loue me, and hath ſaued my life. Wherefore with all my heart I graunt you my loue, wherein none other ſhall haue place during my life: yours I am by good right, &amp; by your conqueſt; my bodie and my life is in your power, and mine honour in your hands: which like a noble and franke Gentleman (as you are) I beſéech you to ſaue.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alector</hi> ſo ioyfull as might be, thanked her right affer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſlie, laying on her kiſſes vpon kiſſes, paſſing from the mouth to the hart, and (as the common ſaying is, Fire go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into the ouen through the mouth) enflaming more and more the ſparkles of this ſecret fire, laid together by plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant touching with the hand, lightened with the winde of gracious ſighings, and frm time to time renued &amp; ſprinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kled with the water of teares, diſtilling from their two hearts, linked in the preſſe of loue. In ſuch ſort, that by contemplation of that ſwéetneſſe, (to tell the truth of that which I haue ſworne) it cauſed the water ſtande in mine eyes, and through ſorrow of being alone, I laid me down to ſleepe vpon a bed of leaues vntill the morning.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:176416:18"/>And therefore, as I would not know anie thing of that which paſſed betwéene them, ſo doo I know nothing: but that in my ſléepe (I know not whether I dreamed or not) mee thought I hearde certaine ſwéete complaints of my Ladie, entermixt with ioy; where uppon willing to ariſe and to goe towards her, ſhe commanded me to ſléepe and take my reſt: which willingly I did till the next morning, that the Sunne was alreadi high, and ſhined into the Caue; and at that inſtant riſing, I behelde this couple of faire yong perſons, which the Sunne diſcouered, lying face to face, and halfe embraced vpon a great bed of moſſe, which was (as I ſuppoſe) the <hi>Centaures</hi> bed. And as I behelde with great pleaſure my Ladie <hi>Noëmia,</hi> how ſhee had gotten a newe and higher coulour than her naturall whiteneſſe, by her morning ſléepe. The horſe who had no more meate, began to gnay verie loud, ſo that <hi>Alector</hi> lept vp, and girded him with his ſword and ſhield, which were néere him: and my Ladie <hi>Noëmia</hi> aroſe alſo, who beholding me, became all redde and ſhamefaſt, for hauing (as I thinke) ſlept ſo long.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Alector,</hi> after that hee had giuen her the Good morrowe, with a gracious accolade and amorous kiſſe, mounted vppon his horſe, ſetting her before him, as light as a yong Goate, and I mounted behinde him vppon the ſtrong grey nagge, on whome theſe three yong bodies full of youthful corage, weighed no more than one onlie man: and ſo wee returned towards the way to <hi>Orbe,</hi> where by the way wee found the dead bodie of <hi>Floridas,</hi> which wee mounted vppon the braunches of a tree, to the ende the Wolues and other ſauage beaſts ſhould not deuoure it, &amp; his gelting féeding with the hackney of my Ladie: vppon whom ſhe mounted, and I on the gelding of <hi>Floridas,</hi> and ſo retourned wee to

<hi>Noëmia:</hi> whom they accounted for certaine loſt, and my ſelfe with her which was the leſſer damage. Whereupon they ſéeing vs returne whole and ſound, at the firſt they were abaſhed, but their abaſhment was ſoone turned into ioye and gratulation, chiefely towards

The which monſter after they had made ſhewe thereof to all the people wondering thereat, they cauſed it to bee fleed, and the ſkin to bee ſtuffed with many ſwéete and drie herbes, and ſet it with the foreſaide maſſie Club vpon one of the gates of the houſe, where it ſéemeth to be yet aliue, and to defend the entrie, with lookes ſo hidious and threatning, that as yet may be ſéene: to the great honor &amp; praiſe of the vanquiſher that hath deſtroyed ſuch a Diuell, the which is

<hi>Centaure</hi> would deale well enough with the Serpent, and ſo deliuer the <hi>Theatre</hi> and Towne of a cruell beaſt, and inward enimie.</p>
            <p>Now is it to be vnderſtood that certain yeres before the
<hi>Archier Croniel,</hi> there was in the Temple another <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chier</hi> called <hi>Calliſte,</hi> a man of great vertue, holie, and a Prophet; who in the feſtiuall dayes when the people aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled themſelues at the ſpectacles in the <hi>Theatre</hi> or at the <hi>Sands,</hi> he would come into the mids of the people, and openlie and eagerlie reprooue them of their vſuall vices, and prophecie vnto them, that of the iuſt bloud ſhed, the earth ſhuld bring foorth a terrible and cruell reuenger, who ſhould deuour their entrailes, vntill ſuch time as the twice borne childe comming from towards the <hi>Pol-Artick,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered them thereof. Thus did this holie man goe erving through the <hi>Theatre</hi> and the <hi>Sand,</hi> ſo as he hindred the<pb n="31" facs="tcp:176416:20"/>plaies, comedies, ſpectacles, and other publique paſtimes: inſomuch that one day, the people prouoked by commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and populous furie, with caſting of ſtones chaſed him vnder a gutter or ſinke of the <hi>Theater,</hi> and therein ſtoned him, leauing his bodie in the filth: which notwithſtanding the next day (after the populous furie paſſed) was drawen out by the Miniſters of the Temple, and honorably buried in the entrie of the Gutter where he was ſtaine, in a ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of blacke marble highlie crected, with his Prophecie written therein: which ſtopped vp the mouth of the gut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Neuertheles, it hid not ſo cloſe the murder of this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie man, but within one yere and a day after, an horrible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge of that fact publiquelie appeared: for as the people in great multitudes were aſſembled to behold the dancing of an Elephant, behold from betwéene the gutter ſtones &amp; the ſepulcher, iſſued out a moſt horrible ſerpent, who flying vpon the people, with his taile &amp; throate deſtroyed a great number, the reſidue with terrible feare running out of the <hi>Theatre:</hi> which thing euerie 3. day hee vſed to execute on the people, who by no engine or humane force could finde remedie, yea he would ſpoyle them in their houſes: vntill at length they were aduiſed euerie wéeke to giue him 2. ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall offenders, whom preſently he would carrie into the gutter, and hold himſelfe therewith content. Then vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the people that the Prophecte of the <hi>Archier Calliſte</hi> was pattly fulſilled, but not wholly at an end.</p>
            <p>Two dairs after the proceſſe of <hi>Alector,</hi> was the time to giue the Serpent his proye: wherefore the great Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentate <hi>Diocles</hi> comming out of the Counſell &amp; the Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers ſtanding about him, and he himſelfe ſet in the iuſtice ſeate, &amp; <hi>Alector</hi> being preſented vnto him, thus pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſentence; The preſent appointed cauſe in the criminall accuſation of the <hi>Gratians</hi> againſt

This ſentence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, was right well allowed and receiued of all the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance (who demaunded not the death of this yong Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, but bore him ſecret fauor, in hope of ſome meruei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous aduenture of the combat, as it came after to paſſe) as alſo of the two parties. For the
<hi>Gratians</hi> thought ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely that their offendor ſhould incontinently be ſwallowed vp of the moſt horrible Serpent, who onely with his vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous breath did ſlaie thoſe who approached him. <hi>Alector</hi> on the other ſide truſting in his hardines, legeritie; and promeſſe, demaunded nothing but that the third day were come, and enquired after if his ſword and ſhield were ſafe? To whome it was anſwered, that hee ſhould not care, but that they ſhould bee deliuered him the day of the Combat. Wherewithall he wonderfullie reioyced, and thanked the Potentate of his clemencie, to the great abaſhment of all the people, who meruelled to ſee him ſo aſſured in ſuch a mortall and preſent perill. And ſo by commaundement he was caried back to the lodging of the Captaine Palatine to be kept in his guarde, where without ceaſing he lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Ladie <hi>Noëmia,</hi> ſpeaking to her as though ſhe had been preſent, and promiſing her reuenge. And in this his great complaint which euerie night from thrée houres to thrée houres hee awaked, hee woulde crie out with a loude veice O

During the which, the ſoueraigne and moſt iuſt Iudge <hi>Diocles</hi> caúſed diligent and ſecret enquirie to be made to knowe who it was, which in that tumult ſhot<pb n="33" facs="tcp:176416:21"/>the arrowe, wherewith the faire, gracious, and vertuous <hi>Noëmia</hi> was ſo accurſedlie ſlaine: wherewith, all in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall were ſad and ſorrowfull. For in the death of this noble Maiden, was buried the flower of beautie, and grace of all the Maidens of the Citie of <hi>Orbe:</hi> for the which cauſe ſhe was deplored, bewailed and lameueet in common dueil, all the people with one voyce crying vengeance and penall iuſtice of the murtherer. But for all the diligent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirie that could be made, nothing could be found, ſauing a light preſumption and ſuſpition of a yong ſpringall cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Coracton,</hi> who had ſometime greatlie wooed her, and of her had gotten nought but a conqueſt of refuſall, for the vicious nature which abounded in him: but this preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was not ſufficient, chieflie becauſe at her burying, this gallant mourned aboue all the reſt: mſomuch that with force of teares, he waſhed away all ſuſpition. The Iudge perceiuing he could finde no other thing, went himſelfe in perſon, (before ſhee was permitted to be buried) to ſee the bodie of the faire
<hi>Noëmia,</hi> lying (before the piller of the 3. Charites) with ſuch grace (albeit dead) that ſhee ſéemed ſwéetelie to ſléepe, more whiter than her ſnowie garments purpleſied in bloud: wherewithall hee himſelfe (beeing a moſt ſeuere man) was mooued to teares, and commanded the bloudie arrowe to be deliuered him, the which after hée had beheld it, lift it vp aloft, demanding if no man knew it: but no anſwere would be giuen. And lifting vp his eyes, he beheld the
<hi>Charites</hi> of alabaſtre, and ſaw that from their ſlonie eyes diſtilled aboundance of teares, lamenting the death of their fourth ſiſter: which he ſhewed vnto the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who of ſuch a miracle began to wéepe, and crie venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for the fact. And amongſt theſe enterpriſes, <hi>Diocles</hi> aduiſed betwéene the hands of two

               <hi>Franc-Gall</hi> hearkening to her and taking her ſong for an Augurie, followed her alwaies vntil ſhe was flowen ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie farre of, and repoſed her ſelfe vpon a high trée attending him. But the
<hi>Archier Croniel</hi> who was vnder the trée, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the foule at a faire aduantage, bent his bow, thinking to let flie an artowe to haue killed her: but as hee was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his marke with eager leuelling, behold a Lioneſſe iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued out of an olde ruined caue which was hard by (where ſhe nouriſhed her yong) and faire and ſoftlie came ſtealing to aſſaile the poore <hi>Archier,</hi> who gaue no béen at all ſauing to his aforeſaid marke: and therewithal had ſtrangled and carried him to her yong, had not <hi>Franc-Gal</hi> (who was not ſarre off) preſently aduanced himſelfe to the ſucceur of the<pb n="36" facs="tcp:176416:23"/>poore
<hi>Archier</hi> with his ſword in his hand, and the ſhield of azure with the Senue of golde in readineſſe. The Beaſt hearing the brute of the ſounding harneſſe (for <hi>Franc-Gal</hi> was armed) and the great noyſe which he made in crying, turned fiercelie againſt him, and caſt her mightie pawes vpon his ſhield, with ſuch a force that ſhee plucked it out of his hand: but <hi>Franc-Gal</hi> ſo puiſſant as a Giant, gaue her ouerthwart the ſides ſuch a ſtroke with his ſword, that he cut her bodie in two péeces; wherewithall the beaſt dying gaue out ſuch an horrible crie that two of her whelpes (ſo yong that ſcarce they could créepe) iſſued out of the ruined caue, crying after their Dam.
<hi>Franc-Gal</hi> ſéeing them ſaid that of an euill beaſt no yong ought to be left, and for that cauſe flewe them both, and in terrour of others (after the manner of <hi>Aphricke</hi>) hung them vp by the tailes vpon a tree, with the moities of the bodie of their Dam, to the great aſtoniſhing of the <hi>Archier:</hi> who being releeued out of the ſodaine feare which he had by reaſon of the Beaſtes clawes, greatlie meruailed of this readie, ſodaine, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked for helpe and ſuccour, and of the valiauncie of this faire olde man: for the which he thanked him right hearte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, knowing for a certaine, that it was hee which by the nighthe reuclation was ſhowed him, ſhould ſaue his life. And for that cauſe demaunded him, what good fortune had brought him ſo happely to his reſcue from the death, and what hee ſought in thoſe Countreyes? (for by his perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, armes and habit, he knew him to be a ſtranger) and promiſing him all aide and ſuccour, in anie thing wherein be might ſerue him.</p>
            <p>I am come hether (quoth <hi>Franc-Gal</hi>) by following the augurie of a Bird, prognoſticating to me, that ſhee would conduct me to the Sands at <hi>Orbe:</hi> but thou, by ſeeking to kil her, haſt cauſed me to loſe her; not regarding or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king heed thy ſelfe of the fierce and ſauage beaſt which was behinde readie to deuoure thee, whiles thou ſoughteſt to eutrap and ſlay my guide: which may be an example, that
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:176416:23"/>oftentimes he which is a murtherer in will, is murthered himſelfe in déede, the taker taken, and the ender brought to an ende.</p>
            <p>It is truth (quoth the <hi>Archier</hi>) and I acknowledge it, and I confeſſe that without thy ſuccour I had béen dead: for the which moſt heartelie I thanke thée; and in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of chaſing away thy Birde which conducted thée, I promiſe thee by the faith of an honeſt ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to lead thee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou wouldeſt goe, and to aide thée in what I maye, tell mee onelie whether thou meaneſt to goe. I pretende (quoth
<hi>Franc-Gall</hi>) to goe to the Sands at <hi>Orbe,</hi> there to finde my faire and yong ſonne <hi>Alector,</hi> being wel brought vp, and a valiant Squire: whom the winde rauiſhed and tranſported from me beeing vppon the Septentrion ſeas, whom I ſhall neuer ſée againe, (alas) as the ſong of this auguring Bird hath preſaged me. Notwithſtanding with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him, I neither can nor wil liue anie longer; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall
<hi>Franc-Gall</hi> caſt out great ſighes from the bottom of his heart) for with him he hath carried away my ſoule &amp; life, as I haue foreſeene in my dreame in <hi>Scythia</hi> vpon the Lyons ſkinnes. O faire childe! O meruailous infant! fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallie engendered, twice borne, ſupernaturallie nouriſhed, growen vp before the time, wiſe before age, ſtrong aboue nature, hardy beyond humanitie, adtienturouſlie fortuned, feared of the wicked, beloued of the good, yea of ſpirites: who by iealouzie (as I thinke) haue rauiſhed and carried thee I knowe not whether. Muſt I for ſo ſmall and briefe a time of enioying the preſence of thine amiable perſon, ſo long ſuffer the abſence of thee, that after my long and tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous peregrination heeretofore ſpent, I muſt nowe againe trauerſe the world to ſeek thee, in feare and doubt whether euer to finde thee? And at this word, the bloudie teares de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from the depth of his heart enterrupted his ſpeach, inſomuch that he remained a little ſpace in ſilence, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to begin his dolefull ſpeach againe in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, turning himſelfe to the <hi>Archier.</hi> And therefore my <pb n="30" facs="tcp:176416:24"/>friend
<hi>Archier,</hi> I tell thee this, that I haue loſt a Sonne called
<hi>Alector,</hi> engendred of <hi>Priſcaraxe</hi> Queene of
<hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie,</hi> one of the wiſeſt and faireſt Dames vnderthe Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens of the Moone; whom I loue, &amp; deſire to ſee againe, (for I haue not ſeene her in moe than eight yeres) neither is it lawfull for me to returne (by reaſon of an othe which I haue taken before her) without bringing her ſonne made Knight, either by my hand, or by the hand of ſome other. For the accompliſhing whereof I haue alreadie aſſayed, but alwaies failed, yea and haue found my ſelfe impotent and forlorne of my members and tongue in going about it: the cauſe thereof I cannot imagine, vnleſſe the Fates haue ordeined that his Knighthood ſhall hee giuen him by ſome other hand and not by mine, the ſoueraigne graunt it may be of a better.</p>
            <p>God grant it (quoth the <hi>Archier</hi>) but what are theſe Fates and Deſtinies whereof thou ſpeakeſt? are they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie puiſſances of Fortune? (which is nothing as I think) No, no (quoth <hi>Franc-Gall</hi>) I call the infaileable and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable ordinances of ſouereigne God that ruleth al with his prouidence, Fates. It is right well ſpoken, and moſt worthelie vnderſtood (quoth the <hi>Archier</hi>) and ſo thou ſeeſt it is not the will ordained by the Souereigne that he ſhall be made Knight by thy hand, it is to be vnderſtood, that it is reſerued for a better, without contrarying or being an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie therewith.</p>
            <p>No more doo I quoth <hi>Franc-Gall,</hi> neither am I ſorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but for that I cannot finde my Sonne <hi>Ale<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

<hi>Priſcaraxe</hi> his mother, neither can hee without mee by ſworne promiſe, which I doubt mee can neuer be accompliſhed of either of vs, as my heart giueth me; remembring the preſages, ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, viſions and dreames, which haue giuen me ſuch ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificating. And herevpon, with greeuous ſighing he helde his peace. Which cauſed the <hi>Archier</hi> to imagine, that the faire Eſquier, which hee vnderſtoode was condemned to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:176416:24"/>fight with the Serpent of the Sands, might well hee the Sonne, which this faire olde man went ſearchng and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing for: and therefore he ſaid vnto him; Thou ſtrange man conſolate thy ſpirit, for I hope to ſhewe thee to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe him whom thou demandeſt. Then
<hi>Franc-Gall</hi> reui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing out of his deep thought, caſt out a great ſigh ſaying; And ſhall I then finde <hi>Alector</hi> carried away by the winds, which can not be folowed? Yea: but I ſhall neuer ſee him againe, for which I muſt die and ende my peregrination, rendring the fire, the light, and vigor of my life, to him of whom I haue receiued it, by a termination of life which is called death, moſt terrible and fearefull of all things: the which is neere and imminent to me, as I ſee and perceiue in my ſelfe. For to euerie man is giuen diuinelie to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee that which is to come, thieflie when he approacheth to the ende of his life, when the ſpirit is more nigh himſelfe, and leſſe wrapped in terreſtriall things, whereby hee ſeeth and vnderſtandeth more cleetelie and purelie: for ſuch is the wil of the diuine prouidence, to the ende man be not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vnprouided, and die beaſtlie.</p>
            <p>Art thou then God quoth the <hi>Archier,</hi> to knowe the things which are to come? God I am not quoth hee, but man, to whom God hath giuen long life, experience, ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the ſtarres, interpretation of auguries, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of my nigh ende, as the diuine Fates haue ordemed, my ſpirite prognoſticated, the oracles foreſhowen me, and the Prophecies foretolde me. What other thing did the dreame of my heart carried away by the flying Baſitiſque preſage me? the oracle of the marinall man <hi>Proteus,</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling my departure without returne? the viſion of the wicked crowe at

<hi>Gallehault,</hi> &amp; the ſong of this loſt blacke bird? Now ſee I wel then my fatal ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to be inſtane, and that I muſt away: let vs therefore, O <hi>Archier</hi> my friend, be going; and conduct me according

And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it happened, that one day being at the foote of this To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, contemplating the meruailous workmanſhip there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and reaſoning with my ſelfe that according to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding height of it, belonged neceſſarily a foundation of terrible depth: whiles I was ouercome with this conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, beholde from a part of Heauen came flying to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me a white feathered Bird, with her beake &amp; legs ſo red as faire corall, her eyes of the colour of fire, flaming in ſhew like two precious carbuncles: who in kiſſing wiſe came and put her beake into my mouth, wherewith by an occult vertue ſhe drew my ſpirite vnto her, leauing my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die in the mean time gaſping and panting much like to one in a traunce. And ſo hauing eleuated my ſpirite vnto the lower Region of the aier, not by flight vpwards, but as it were turning &amp; going round about all the climates of the world (like thoſe who by often winding clime the rude and high mountaines) vntill it was eleuate right towards the North ouer an Iſland called <hi>Ireland,</hi> where ſodainly this Bird left mee, and let mee fall ſhooting like a tempeſt into this Iſle, in a great hole or well right deepe: where in the middeſt of the darkneſſe, by a little glittering of a ſulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian light, I perceiued the depth of this round Tower, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſed euen from the ſuperficialitie of the earth vnto the point centrique or centure of the ſame: and below a Bara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thre or eternall priſon, where by the infernall obſcuritie I could ſee nothing but darkneſſe diſpearſed vpon the face of the depths: but well might I heare horrible cries, &amp; feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full hurlings mingled with plaints &amp; groanes like to men tormented, and furious enraged beaſts fighting amongſt <pb n="45" facs="tcp:176416:28"/>themſelues, throwing and biting one another in extreame rage.

Yea, yea, quoth I, and heard fearfull cries which cauſed me to retire: but I knewe not what it ſhould be, vnleſſe it be the eternal priſon of the wicked Giants <hi>Triphon</hi> and <hi>Briaro,</hi> with their complices and followers, who were not afraide to ſet themſelues againſt the Soueraigne: vpon whome (being caſt downe and deſolated) the mountaines &amp; great rockes, which are the foundations of the auncient Tower which thou didſt behold, haue been throwen: the which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes they ſhake &amp; cauſe to tremble by the impatience of intollerable paines, in ſhaking ſometimes the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by the aboundaunce of water caſt and throwen out by their conduct, and other whiles by the impetuoſitie of the windes comming from their deſpitefull ſighings: &amp; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time by the violence of the fire co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming out of their throat, and by the inflamed vapor of forceable ire and outragious wrath.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the prime of my youth, (about 470. yeres paſſed) I being of the age of knowledge, as it were 49. yeres; there came into theſe parts an vnknowen man, ill ſhaped and blacke like to an <hi>Aethiopian,</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe verie rich in ſiluer, golde, precious ſtones, and other mettalls, &amp; for the reſt, of a great <pb n="49" facs="tcp:176416:29"/>and ſubtill ſpirite, and excéeding well learned in euerie ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence farre aboue all other that he met. This man hauing taken his dwelling in the Citie of
<hi>Orbe,</hi> (whereto we are now going) and there (by reaſon of the ſtore of money that he poſſeſſed, and for that the Towne (by meanes of the Sea néere adiacent, and of the riuers, ports and paſſages thereto adioyning) is very commodious for a place of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize) he helde and hore the ſtate of a merchant &amp; Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer. Of what merchandize quoth
<hi>Franc-Gall,</hi> made he his traffique? He was ſaid the <hi>Archier,</hi> a temporall mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant: for he ſold for time by compt and meaſure. So this temporall Merchant called <hi>Mammon,</hi> holding a famous Banque in
<hi>Orbe,</hi> became amorous of a right faire and moſt renowned Maiden, of one of the richeſt and nobleſt houſes in the Citie, which Maiden was called <hi>Thanais.</hi> This faire <hi>Mammon</hi> beeing thus taken with the loue of <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nais,</hi> began to court her euill fauouredlie enough, and more imperiouſly than graciouſly, by vanting of himſelfe, oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his great riches and cunning, and with diſpray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and blaming of all others, chiefly of the vertuous: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that, he ſought to allure her by rich gifts &amp; preſents, of golde, of gemmes, rings and iewels, (although by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he was verie couetous) but aboue all with moſt faire and ample promiſes. But the Maiden, to whome theſe proud brauados were intollerable, and who had perhaps lodged her heart in ſome higher place, reiected all his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, refuſed his offers, ſhunned his encountrie, &amp; would giue no eare to his proud words; as one whom ſhe hated as much as he deſired her, both for his improbous and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracious behauiour, &amp; for his diſpleaſant geſture. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon, beeing aduertiſed by one of her Morian ſlaues, that ſhe was accuſtomed euerie morning ſo ſoone as ſhe roſe, to goe halfe vncloathed with her haire hanging down, to take the aire in the garden, to refreſh and waſh her ſelfe and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, in the ſiluered ſtreames of the fountaine, which ranue through the ſame: he (for a certaine péere of money, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe<pb n="50" facs="tcp:176416:30"/>of redemption out of bondage, and ſetting at libertie of this her Morian ſlaue) was by her let in to the garden; where he hid himſelfe in a thicke Arbour till the morning, that his deſired <hi>Thanais</hi> ſhould come: who according to her accuſtomed manner failed not. Then he from his em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſhment ſeeing this faire yong creature comming, coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with a ſingle peticote of light ſattin, and abating the deawe with her bare féete whiter than Alabaſter, her fayre armes (naked and beautefied with liuely whitenes) being diſcouered: her breaſts (borne out with two apples of yuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, or pappes of the ſame coulour) lying open; her head lightly truſſed vp with a faire &amp; white kerchiefe of fine lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen, behind the which one might behold her golden haires, whereof one part vntruſſed hong downe ouer her necke &amp; ſhoulders, and another part friſſeled and curled deſcended wauing ouer her cleare eyes, like two peéces of ſiluer new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie forged, which being ſomewhat aggrauated with ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much ſleepe, and ſéeming as yet neuer ſtroken with loue, made them haue the greater grace. <hi>Mammon</hi> out of his embuſhment perceiuing ſuch diuine humanitie, with paine ſhould he deſiſt or defer his ioyes from running to imbrace her: notwithſtanding loue which in his firſt mouements is neuer without feare, defended him, and withheld him, till ſuch time as <hi>Thanais</hi> without eſpying him was arriued at the fountaine: where (as ſhee was beholding in the reuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berant cleareneſſe of the Water, the flower of her fayre youth, making her ſelfe readie to waſh her eyes, hands, and vermilion lips) ſodainly behold
<hi>Mammon</hi> (comming out of his den) threwe himſelfe vnawares vpon her with ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned armes, ſpeaking to her as amorouſly as he could, and preſented vnto her with humble ſutes, and affectuous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, both his goods and perſon; adioyning to his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, threatnings and outrages: in ſuch ſort that ſéeing her obſtinate refuſall, her turning away of her viſage, and her repulſing of him away with her armes, with a furious heate which inflamed him, he aſſaied to force her, and to ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſh
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:176416:30"/>her of that by violence, which otherwiſe he could not obtaine by loue, hope of promiſes, nor feare of threate nings. The ſilly Marden trembling with feare, ſeeing her bodie and honour in danger by the aſſault of this furious man, caſt foorth a loud crie, calling to her aide two brothers which ſhe had, yong and braue men, inhabiting next to the garden: who vnderſtanding the fearful voyce of their wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beloued Siſter, ſodainly went foorth in armes, with a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie of ſeruants well prouided. Whom <hi>Mammon</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing comming towards him with terrible furie, knew right well, that it was not verie ſure for him to remaine there. Whereuppon mortall feare ſo adioyned lvinges to his light heeles, that by a liuely courſe he leaped ouer the wal, and ſaued himſelfe by ſwiftneſſe, and eſcaped the hands of her brethren ſeekers of reuenge: who hauing loſt the raui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſher, tooke their wofull Siſter, and conſolating her with aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, led her into the chamber, to reuiue her afrighted ſpirites.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mammon</hi> thus eſcaped from their hands, found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe merueilouſly confounded and troubled with the obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate refuſall and proud diſdaine (as he thought) of his wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beloued <hi>Thanais:</hi> whereby neuertheleſſe his ardant loue was nothing at all cooled or diminiſhed, but contrariwiſe, more enflamed and augmented. For euen as a Cannon ſhot ſtriking againſt a rocke or hard wall, by reaſon of ſo ſharpe encountrie, receiueth newe ſtrength of impetuous retire: euen ſo the furious courage of <hi>Mammon</hi> hauing encountred ſo ſharpe refuſall of faire <hi>Thanais,</hi> &amp; ſo ſore a chaſe of her brothers, chafed himſelfe more aboundantlie with deſpiteful anger, and the furie of his loue or rather of rage, receiued more vehement force, by the offence of ſo rude a ripulfe. Wherupon there remaining no more mean or hope of obtaining his deſire; he tooke him to his wicked artes whereof he was a ſouereigne Maſter, and purpoſed to make her loue him by force and againſt nature, by the vertue of a <hi>Philtre</hi> or louing poyſon, which he compoſed
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:176416:31"/>in an apple of <hi>Venus,</hi> commonly called a loue apple, or an apple of follie, made with the bloud of a wagtayle, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther drugs fit for that purpoſe, odorated with manie hote ſpices, ſweetened in ſugar thrée times baked, and enchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with thrée wordes which he knewe to be proper to the making of the ſame: in ſuch ſort, that he made an apple of confiture, right ſweete to the ſmell, and right good to the taſte, but moſt dangerous to the bodie and heart, as the iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue ſhewed. This being done, he practiſed with the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riau ſlaue for money, promiſing her affranchment and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance out of boudage, if ſhe would and could finde the meanes to make her Ladie <hi>Thanais</hi> in ſome collation to eate this apple, hauing ſuch vertue, that whoſoeuer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented it, ſhould be in fauor and grace of the receiuer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and yeeld to the giuer great aduantage. The Morian ſlaue being couetous, and giuing ouer much beliefe to his faire words and flattering promiſes, and preſuming alre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of her libertie &amp; franchiſe, which aboue all other things ſhe moſt eſtéemed and deſired, withall, of the good will of her miſtreſſe; right willingly tooke both the money, and the apple, which was put in a veſſell of Chriſtall, promiſing him that ſhe would miniſter it to her Miſtreſſe, with the firſt opportunitie; which thing ſhe delayed not to bring to paſſe. For the ſelfe ſame day that
<hi>Thanais</hi> was ſo ouerta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and put to ſuch diſtreſſe by
<hi>Mammon</hi> (as it hath bin ſaid) ſhe remained ſo mooued and altred, that in the Eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing at her going to bed, her heart began to faile her: for the aide whereof, her Slaue preſented her with this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected apple, which ſhe found verie delicious to the taſte, inſomuch that her ſpirites reuiued againe: and after ſhee had dronke a little wine, ſodainly ſhee fell into a profound ſléepe, yet neuertheleſſe being troubled with dreames and terrible ſantaſies, which ſhe witneſſed by the turnings of her face, diſorderly mouing of hir limmes, and profound ſighes intermingled from time to time with cries, in ſuch ſort, that when ſhe awaked, ſhe was found to haue loſt her <pb n="53" facs="tcp:176416:31"/>ſenſes, tranſported of her ſpirites, and become altogether fooliſh. Finally, after long torment of bodie and mind, by reaſon of the inflamation of that villanous apple, the poore and miſerable <hi>Thanais</hi> died, her bodie remaining after her death ſo horrible and hideous to behold, that they made no greater haſt than to goe burie her, and to carrie her to a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcher in the ende of a field, apperteining to their fathers houſe, adioyning to the high way where we now are, and verie neare to this place, for as I thinke, behold the ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher which alreadie beginneth to appeare vnto vs, wherein
<hi>Thanais</hi> with her Morian ſlaue were buried. Who in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morce of conſcience of this her wicked miniſterie, went and hanged her ſelfe, hauing beheld the heauie aduenture of her traiterous ſeruice, and well knowing ſhe could not eſcape the handes of the two brethren, who would reuenge the death of their ſiſter vpon her. Behold what ſhe got by the promiſe of <hi>Mammon,</hi> ſhewing in effect that the reward of ſinne is death. Thus were cheſe two bodies buried in this ſepulcher which thou ſéeſt before vs, which we may goe to ſée, and there repoſe our ſelues a while and take breath. In ſaying whereof, theſe two olde men approached to a ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of Maible, which was at the ende of a field on the left hand of the high way. For the cuſtome at that time was to build their ſepulchers euerie man in his proper ground, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long by the high way ſide, to the end that trauellers in ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſting and repoſing themſelues vpon the ſtone, might bée occupied in reading their Epitaphs: which theſe two olde men did, turning towards the Tombe. And the good <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chier</hi> laid downe his bowe and quiuer vpon the ſtone with a bottle full of wine, whereof he dranke firſt out of a ſiluer goblet which hee had about him, and after preſented it to <hi>Franc-Gal,</hi> who receiued it with a good will, and drank to him againe. Theſe two olde men being thus repoſed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the lower ſteps of the ſepulcher, made their coliation with a morſell of white bread, and the wing of a roſted and ſpiced Pheaſant, which the <hi>Archier</hi> had ſlaine the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:176416:32"/>and brought with him in a faire napkin for his refec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the fields, as ordinarily he was accuſtomed to do in going to the chaſe: and ſo they drank either of them once. And afterwards whiles the Squire made an ende of emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tying the bottle, they mounted the ſteps of the ſepulcher to ſée if they could behold ſome Epitaph, where they found in a ſtone of flouriſhing Porphire variable of colours and waued like the ſtreames of a ſwift Riuer, which was vpon the Tombe, a blacke knight of brown Marble engrauen, bearing a guilded ſhield, holding by the mane a fair white mare of ſnowie Alabaſter, inforcing himſelfe to mount vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her; but the mare by her figure ſhewed her ſelfe ſo rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious in flinging that he could not, wherefore through an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger he thruſt her through the body with his flaming ſword, out of which wound in ſtead of bowells iſſued a Serpent, and at the feete thereof was ſet a Mowle engrauen in Jeate.</p>
            <p>

<hi>Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon:</hi> the white Mare figured the faire <hi>Thanais:</hi> the Mowle was a token of the Morian ſlaue: the holding of of the Mare by the mayne, and aſſaying to mount vppon her, ſignified the forcement which
<hi>Mammon</hi> would haue done in the garden: the kicking of the white Mare repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the refuſall of <hi>Thanais:</hi> the ſtroake of the burning ſword, was the poyſoning apple, and the wound her death; but of the Serpent which iſſued therout, he could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture what it betokened, vntill the <hi>Archier</hi> enterpreted the ſame afterwards, as you ſhall heare.</p>
            <p>Hauing thus contemplated the figures vpon the ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, they might perceiue belowe vpon the ſtone of Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phirie foure verſes engrauen: whereof the firſt two were written in ancient letters of black colour, and the two laſt<pb n="55" facs="tcp:176416:32"/>in red letters of a ſanguine colour, which ſeemed to them later &amp; freſher written than the firſt, as in truth they were according to the aduenture which followed, &amp; the four ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Epitaph were theſe.

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Heſe two olde men being repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed on the bankes of the ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, the old <hi>Archier</hi> began the continuaunce of his tale in this wiſe. After that the two bodies of <hi>Thanais</hi> &amp; her Morian ſlaue, were entombed, and the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, according to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of the Countrey, in dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full manner accompliſhed, each one retired to reſt. Onely
<hi>Mammon</hi> remained in a terrible vnquietneſſe, not finding reſt either of ſoule or bodie: for the furies of remorce, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, diſdaine, wrath, wayling, deſpite, impoſſible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,<pb n="56" facs="tcp:176416:33"/>and rage of vnbridled loue, ſhooke continuallie before the eyes of his fantaſticall vnderſtanding, their burning &amp; bloudie torches: in ſuch ſort, that his vehement paſſions would neither ſuffer him to ſléepe or reſt, eſpecially the loue of the deceaſed
<hi>Thanais,</hi> which by ſo much more was enflamed in him, as the hope of euer obtaining his deſire was furtheſt from him. So as when he would ſettle him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to ſléepe, the figure of <hi>Thanais</hi> ſéemed to preſent it ſelfe before him in ſuch beautie and grace as hee had ſéene her in the garden. And as louers forge dreames according to their ſenſuall appetites, and diſordinate deſires, he ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deinly imagined, and fully perſwaded with himſelfe, that
<hi>Thanais</hi> was not dead, but by force of the <hi>Philtre,</hi> onely falne into a Lechargie and ſwowue: and that by going to the place where ſhe lay entombed, he might yet enioy that without let or hindrance, which he ſo long had deſired. Vpon this, ſléepe ouercame him, and a Phantaſine in the the likenes of <hi>Thanais</hi> diſformed, pale, and deadly, ſéemed to appeare vnto him, ſaying; <hi>Mammon</hi> thou ſléepeſt, and I ſuffer in attending thée: why comſt thou not to the place wher I am, to take without danger, that which once thou wouldeſt with ſo great perill rauiſh from me. Vpon this his dogge barked and <hi>Calyph</hi> his Page fearefully began to crie: and he himſelfe wakening, demanded what he ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led? For that (quoth the page) I haue ſéene a flying ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent iſſue from behind the curtaine of your bed, and depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting hereout by the louer hole of the chimney. <hi>Mammon</hi> hearing this talke, and conferring this viſion with his dreame, found himſelfe ſo diſturbed, that through the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience of loue he aroſe, &amp; taking with him for ſole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion his onely page as yet verie fearfull, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the night, came to the place where wee now are, mounted vp to the ſepulcher, and (with his helpe) remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the ſtone from the monument (for at that time theſe fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures were yet vnplaced) and cauſing his page to keep the watch, leaſt anie one ſhould come and deſcrie them, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred<pb n="57" facs="tcp:176416:33"/>into the ſepulcher, where (in the perfourming of his deteſtable aſſignment) he employed a great part of the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent night, whoſe obſcuritie and darkneſſe ſéemed to him ſufficient to couer and cloake his villanie. Which beeing done, he might heare the voyce of ſome wicked ſpirit ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king through the carrion carcaſſe of the Morian ſlaue, vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering theſe ſpeaches following;
<hi>Mammon</hi> thou haſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten a childe. Returne therefore to this place, and at this inſtant hower, within two and twentie dayes to receiue the fruite of thy ſéede, whereof faile not: for if thou doo, our Prince ſhall not faile to fetche thée by his Legionaries to thy great euil and torment. How can this be (quoth <hi>Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>) that within thrée wéekes the childe ſhould be grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to perfect birth, whereto nine moneths are requiſite or at leaſt ſeauen? An euill wéede (quoth the ſprite) commeth foorth ſooner than a good hearbe, beſides that thou muſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that when nature féeleth her ſelfe to faile &amp; tende to corruption, then ſhe forceth her ſelfe the more, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunceth more faſter to generation. And for that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirce of this dead bodie muſt die ſhortly, it haſteneth it ſelf to bring foorth the fruite of thy ſéede before the due time, which thou muſt come to receiue within thrée times feauen dayes, at the hower appointed: wherefore faile not; &amp; now get thée hence, for thou haſt no more to doo here. This ſaid, the voyce ceaſed, and <hi>Mammon</hi> ſore afraid iſſued out of the ſepulcher, whereupon with the aide of his Page <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyph</hi> he laid the ſtone, &amp; returned to his lodging, accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting theſe things to his man, who was priuie to all his dealings, eſpecially of this his loue toward the deceaſed <hi>Thanais,</hi> and with him conſulted whether he ſhuld obay the Moriſquine ſpirite, and returne againe thether within thrée wéekes, or no: which thing after ſome deliberation taken, was concluded. And the two and twentieth daye after, at the ſame nightly houre, they came to the place and remooued the ſtone from the monument; whereinto

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:176416:34"/>fire, which ſparkled betwéene the heads of the dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, he might perceiue an Infant newly borne, laid at the féete of <hi>Thanais,</hi> vppon the ende of the winding ſhéete, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene two women of terrible aſpect, &amp; of diuers formes; for the one had a viſage pleaſant and laughing, but bliſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with diuers colours like the worke of a rich iewell en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameled, and yet neuertheleſſe delectable to behold: and ſhe like a Fatalleſſe (as ſhe was) predeſtinated the child in this ſort; Thou childe <hi>Deſalethes,</hi> (for ſo thou ſhalt be named, in beeing borne without terme, &amp; nouriſhed without milke) I foretell thée, that thou ſhalt be the greateſt liar of this world, a ſimuler and diſſembler in words and déedes, in al falſe workes and ſpeaches vnder apparaunce and colour of amiable veritie, and cleane contrarie in couert thought to that which thou ſhalt ſpeake in open words; euen as thy externall members are faire, and thy interuall foule and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie. (As in truth this childe named
<hi>Deſalethes</hi> was, his face, neck, hands, and all that outwardly appeared, being verie white, faire, gracious to the eye, pleaſant, and allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, holding the forme and beautie of the mother: but the reſt of his bodie and members which were hidden, were ſwart and filthie, according to the deformitie and obſcuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of his father.) After that this firſt Fatalleſſe had thus ſiniſterly preſaged vppon this byformed Brat, the ſecond Fatalleſſe who was of viſage more ſad, ſeuere, and of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour pale, (but white and cleanly) thus propounded his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtime; Like as you (my ſiſter <hi>Calendre</hi>) haue caſt your ſort vpon this childe, that he ſhall liue ſo long as hee conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth in his lying; euen ſo I doo deſtine him, that he ſhall die for telling the truth, and that ſo ſoone as hee ſhall haue ſpoken it. So be it Siſter <hi>Clarence</hi> (quoth
<hi>Calendre</hi>) in giuing their hands right and left the one to the other, and ſo comoyned they laid them vppon the head of the childe, who at that inſtant aroſe, as it were of the age of fourtéen yeares, furiouſly-crying; <hi>Mammon,</hi> thou honeſt man, thou ſhalt leaue me here rather buried than borne. No, no, my<pb n="59" facs="tcp:176416:34"/>deare ſonne (quoth <hi>Mammon</hi>) that will I not truly: and therewith imbraced him; and the two Faireſſes ſodainely vaniſhed away, with the ſulphurian fire, which turned to a moſt ſtinking ſmoke: and at that verie inſtant iſſued out of the bodie of the Moore, the horrible voyce of a wicked ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, thundring out theſe words.

Which was no ſooner laid, but a thunder clap and lightning fell from Heauen vppon the plate of Porphirie, with the ſtatues of blacke Marble, of Alabaſter, and Ieate, in figure of a blacke Knight, a yong Mare, and of a Mowle, euen as we haue now ſéene them.

But alreadie hee lied according to his naturall propertie. For he both ſaw the two Siſters, and vnderſtood their talke yea vetter than <hi>Mammon,</hi> as one that was betweene them. The father hearing his young ſonne anſwere ſo ſimply, with a white viſage, faire, ſweete, and amiable, and eſteeming that he ſaid truth (which was nothing leſſe) reckoned to him the preſages that he ſhould not die, but for telling the truth, whoſe contrarie is lying: and therefore for the conſeruation of his durable life (like a moſt wicked man as hee was) hee exhorted him to ſet all faith and truth aſide; and to ſettle himſelfe continually to ſpeake and practiſe lyings, fraudes and diſloyal inſidelitie: whereto the ſimple babe anſwered, hee knewe not how to lie, neither could he doo it. But therein he lied ſo egregi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and filthily, that the aire therewith was infected, as if it had been with the breath of a Baſiliſque: for he could
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:176416:35"/>no more lie, than the Baſiliſque kill, the Wolfe deuoure, the water drowne, and the fire burne, whoſe primitiue beginnings were for that intent. In ſuch ſort, that when he ſpake moſt ſimply, he then moſt of all lied. Yet his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being deceiued in his falſe &amp; diſſembling ſimplicitie, beleeued him, and being come to his lodging, incontinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie he apparelled him in braue and ſumptuous aray (which he could doo verie well, being one of the richeſt in the Citie of <hi>Orbe</hi>) and decked him in cloathes of golde, ſiluer, and and ſilke of all kind of colours (except white and red) but ſpecially of changeable colours, and of all ſeuerall ſorts of ſilkes, mettalls, and cloathes of tiſſue, embroderie and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and of all the diuers cuts and variable faſhions, which could newly be found throughout al the Nations of the world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Deſalethes</hi> thus apparelled with ſuch rich and braue ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites, and for euerie day a new change, which couered his blacke laydneſſe, and ſet out the faire and white parts of his viſage, necke, breaſt and hands, hee ſeemed ſo faire a childe, ſo pleaſant and gracious to all, that euer ie one tooke of him great pleaſure. Wherefore his father <hi>Mammon</hi> ſeeing him ſo deſireable, loued him greatly, and fearing the ſort which hee had vnderſtood, (which was to dye for ſaying the truth) and beleeuing (that which in lying he had told him) that he knew not how to lie: gaue him in charge to be taught to a right excellent Maſter, who of that Art made profeſſion, not publiquelie, but priuely, and ſecretly; neither read he but by night. This good Doctor was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Pſeudomanthanon,</hi> moſt ſkilfull in the Artes of his profeſſion, which were Magicke, Cabalicke, Thalmud, hypocxiſie, brotherie, idolatrie, iudiciall Aſtrologie, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtrie, Poeſie, Alchymie, Emperie, Medicaſtrie, leger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demaine, ſubtiltie, pillerie, banquerie, vſurie, intereſterie, change, barterie, beggerie, falſifying of weights &amp; mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, forgerie, hap-lourderie, reuerie, and carrionly gin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gembrie, poyſoning, couſning, dicing, brawling, mocke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,

To this right cunning Doctor, was this fine diſciple <hi>Deſalethes</hi> deliuered to bee taught all theſe good artes of falſitie and menterie; who in verie little time ſo ſtudied, and in ſo ſhort time aduaunced himſelfe in the ſcience and practiſe of theſe artes of lying, that he paſſed and ſurmounted his Maſter: and deceiued him often times in his owne deceipt; ſpecially in the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for his teaching: for hauing agreed with him on this condition, that he ſhuld pay him one talent valued at 500. crownes, in the reward of his teaching, in the firſt cauſe that by menterie or fineneſſe he ſhuld win in turning right with ſleight: the accord being written and ſigned, it fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that
<hi>Pſeudomanthanon</hi> ſeeing his ſcholler <hi>Deſalethes</hi> to haue well profited in his artes, demaunded of him his promiſed ſalarie: but
<hi>Deſalethes</hi> denied it him, telling him flatly, that he ought him nothing. Whereupon <hi>Pſeudo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manthanon</hi> called him before a Iudge where he appeared. And the Maſter after he had made his demaund, and ſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen the accord of the bargaine, thus propounded his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon cutting on both ſides in this wiſe; O foole, and euill aduiſed Scholler, dooſt thou not knowe, that neceſſarily thou ſhalt be condemned to pay me, whether thou winneſt <pb n="63" facs="tcp:176416:36"/>this matter, or no. For if thou win it, it cannot be but by fine policie, &amp; wreſting the law, whereby thou muſt needs pay me according to our accord and writing, which is ſuch that at the firſt cauſe by thee craftely gotten, thou ſhouldeſt pay me a talent: but to the contrarie, if thou doſt loſe, thou ſhalt be condemned to pay me by execution of the Iudges ſentence; and ſo canſt thou not eſcape to pay me. To this, the well learned ſcholler by a crooked pearcing, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie reaſon, anſwered in this forme; O good Maſter, and ſubtill Doctor, ſauing thine honour: thou takeſt not this argument by the right end: but contrariwiſe as it ſeemeth to me, I ought neceſſarily to be abſolued of thy demaund, whether I win this matter or loſe it. For if I win it, I ſhall be quit by the abſolute ſentence of the Iudge: and if that I loſe it, I ought to paye thee nothing, according to the accord ſet down in thy writing: where it is agreed, that I ſhould not pay thee vntill the firſt matter that I ſhould get by fine deceipt: wherefore not winning this firſt, if I bee condempned, the condition of the bargaine beeing not come, the bargaine is nothing, &amp; I ſhall owe thee nought. And thus (O abſurd Maſter) I cannot faile to eſcape thy purſute.</p>
            <p>The Iudge hearing ſuch alterations by contraries and indiſſoluable <hi>Antistrophes,</hi> and not knowing what iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to giue, ſent them both for an hundred yeares and one before <hi>Rhadamant</hi> the infernall Iudge, the whole Bench crying after them in execration of their knauerie, this ſentence afterwards moſt renowmed: <hi>Of an euill Crowe a naughtie egge, of an euill Maſter a worſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.</hi> Behold how

For the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidue, the beſt childe in the world, a pleaſant liar, a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous flatterer, an aſſured boaſter, well languaged, well ſpoken, and a moſt curteous Curtizan, and for that cauſe welcome to all companie: bringing his deceiptfull words and déedes ſo finely about like a <hi>Mercuriall Vliſſes</hi> that it was alwaies to his profite and vantage, and without lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing<pb n="65" facs="tcp:176416:37"/>anie thing wherein he might be diſcouered or ouerta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in. Sauing that an ancient man called <hi>Cron,</hi> who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies inuiſibly folowed him pace by pace, and obſerued al his déedes &amp; ſayings, after he had long time endured them, he finally diſcouered and ſtirred againſt him innumerable people whom he had all deceiued and deſrauded one by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.

Whereof being at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taint and conuinced (albeit no torture nor torments could make him confeſſe or acknowledge it) he was notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding declared a publique enemie, and condemned to looſe his head, and that all his goods ſhould be confiſcate to the Prince of <hi>Orbe.</hi> His Maſter <hi>Pſeudomanthanon</hi> féeling the winde thereof, ſodainly vaniſhed, &amp; gained with his héeles, taking his flight from thence, and hiding himſelfe in diuers ſecrete places, whereas yet hee maketh profeſſion of his clandeſtinall lectures.

But on the contrarie, all the world, yea thoſe of his owne faction reclaymed againſt him in execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, crying with aloud voyce, Take him away, take him away, kill, kill the wicked man.

With this aſſurance he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched and mounted vp into the place of puniſhment, and when he was vpon the ſcarfoll <hi>Must-dy,</hi> the executioner would haue bound and blinded him: No, no (quoth hee in lying according to his naturall diſpoſition) I will neuer runne away, haue thou no feare, for I haue enough for vs both. In ſaying thus, he knéeled downe before the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtone, and whiles the Executioner prepared his ſharpe cutting ſword, he turned his viewe openlie to all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: to whom (that hee might make his laſt lye) hee ſayd with a lowd voyce, Farewell yee people of <hi>Orbe,</hi> I goe now to die. This ſayd, hee enclined his bodie, and the hangman who had alreadie prepared his ſword, in auay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it, with a rude ſtroke cut off his head.</p>

<hi>Priſcaraxe</hi> my moſt deare friend, although my departure from thée bee as ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful, as my conuerſation with thée pleaſant; yet is it ſo that there is nothing more certain, than that within foure daies I ſhall depart from thée: for ſo it is neceſſarie aſwell for me, as for the reſt of the world, to circuite which, &amp; the things therein conteined, I haue an immutable deſire, as alſo to accompliſh a certain vow of pilgrimage that I haue made to the ſoueraign temple, which I neuer ſaw, neither know where to finde: but I haue vowed, &amp; it behooueth me to doo it; neither will I ceaſe trauelling till I haue found it. Why then (quoth ſhe) lead me with you, &amp; leaue me not here deſolate in danger of beaſts, &amp; men almoſt wild, more dangerous than ſauage beaſts: who ſéeing me (imperfect of humane nature, finiſhing in forme of a Serpent, enemie to humane kinde) will kill or burne me as a monſter, and with mee the fruite which is come of your ſéede, in my wombe, euen your Sonne, as yet vnperfectly formed:
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:176416:49"/>of whom the vaticinations haue promiſed ſo great things, that onely might moue me to accept perpetuall companie with you in your farre voyages. My great friend <hi>Priſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raxe</hi> (quoth I) if I ſhuld condiſcend to your requeſt, made by ſimplicitie and ignorance of things, and that I ſhould accord to your demaund in leading you with me: truly, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der colour of friendſhip and humanitie, I ſhould be a moſt cruell and vnnaturall enemie to you, &amp; put you, your child and mine, to the hazard of cruell death. For how long the wayes be, how intollerable the trauells, how fearefull the dangers, truly your tender age and weake kinde can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly geſſe: beſides that, according to the forme which you haue, you are not able to trauell without legs on the land, nor ride on my horſe
<hi>Hippopotame</hi> on the waters. For a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all, his nature is that he carrieth no female kinde, but he caſteth and drowneth it and all the charge therewith: &amp; ſo ſhould you giue annoyance to your ſelfe, to me, &amp; mine, and put vs all in mortall perill. Wherefore it is neceſſarie that you remaine here in peace and ſure reſt, where before my departure I wil cauſe you to haue not onely aſſurance of your honor and life, but alſo authoritie and reuerence to your perſon. And eſteeme not your ſelfe abandoned of me, ſeeing that of my proper blood (as you aſſure me) I leaue you another <hi>Me,</hi> that is the child engendred by me in you; who ſhall (vnleſſe my augurie deceiue me) be valiant, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and liverall; and therefore ſo ſoone as he is borne (if percaſe I be abſent) cauſe him to be named <hi>Alector.</hi> For he is engendred vnder my Planet, and ſhalbe borne of the daughter of <hi>Phoebus</hi> in his plaine flower, extract out of the ſerpents egge, which is your bodie hauing the forme of a
<hi>Baſiliſq,</hi> that is to ſay <hi>Royall.</hi> And ſo ſhall be accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the dreame which I phantaſied when I found my ſelfe firſt embraced of you. Wherefore, leauing you a childe of my bodie, you ought not to thinke me wholly ſeperated fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you. Beſides that, be you aſſured, that ſo ſoone as I haue atchieued an ende of my Peregrination, which ſhall bee ſo<pb n="89" facs="tcp:176416:49"/>ſoone as poſſibly I may) I wil returne againe to you with great ioy: and ſo I promiſe you by the faith of an honeſt man and of a true friend. And in ſigne of this faith promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, I giue and leaue you this ring of golde, empaled with a moſt fine flaming Carbuncle giuing light in darkneſſe: whoſe nature by compoſition and caſting in worke vnder this <hi>Syderation</hi> is ſuch, that if I be priſoner or locked in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie ſtraight, it will become pale like the light of a raynie Sunne; if I be ſick, it wil be heauie like lead; if I be dead, it will wholly loſe the ſplendor, and become blacke like a dead coale: but if I be in libertie and in health, it will hold his viue colour ſhining as preſently you ſée it. Of al which effects, the ſignification is written in theſe words, <hi>Tant, que viuray.</hi> Wherefore my moſt dearly beloued, I leaue you, and giue you this ring for aſſurance and gage of my faith, (as the Ring is a proper <hi>Symbole</hi> of loue and faith) praying you in this confidence and ſure hope of my return, for the loue of me to kéepe, and often to behold it with cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious inſpection of my behauiour. And this ſaid, I put the ring vpon her finger, &amp; kiſſed her, which ſhe receiued both graciouſly and amiably, but with abundance of vnfained &amp; heartie teares: neuertheleſſe ſomewhat conſolated vppon hope of my faithfull promiſed returne, ſhee appeaſed and comforted her ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Now during the while that I tarried with her, I paſſed away my time principally in two things; the one was to get from the mountaines, rocks, and caues, ſuch diſperſed and wandring men, women, &amp; children, as for feare of the <hi>Cataclyſme</hi> were fled for ſauegard vnto the high places: where they were become barbarous, and almoſt ſauage. Whome neuertheleſſe by ſweete language and ſome good deedes I drew vnto me in the plaine field, &amp; cauſed them to taſte the fruites of the earth, chiefly of grapes, which at that time wer ripe (for it was about the time of
<hi>Autumne</hi>) and enſigned him how to plant and dreſſe the vineyards, to mollifie them, and to draw the ſweete liquor of wine from
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:176416:50"/>them, &amp; thereof gaue them to taſte, which they found mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueilous good and delicate: the like did I of other fruites of the earth, as of wheat and other ſéedes. For before they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with acornes and fleſh, like wilde bores, wolues, &amp; ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uening beaſts; yea ſome liued with mans fleſh, and dranke nothing but ſimple water, or els the milk of beaſts, which alreadie they knewe well to feede in the paſtures of the mountaines. Likewiſe I taught them to cut and felwood, to ſquare ſtones, to temper fat earth, and therewithall to builde houſes and villages along the water ſide for their dwellings, and ſure defence of their perſons and cattell, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the iniurie of raine, winde, and ſtormes, and againſt the violence of ſauage beaſts, and to aſſemble themſelues by nombers in redoubtable defence againſt thoſe fierce and ſauage creatures: exhorting them to ciuil and honeſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie, to mutuall aide, and not one to outrage and harme another, to chaſtize and puniſh thoſe who hurt one another by common accord, and for the executing of Iuſtice to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute a wiſe Gouernour ouer them, to whom, al with one conſent ſhall beare reuerence as alreadie they had done to me. All which things they willingly tooke and learned like men who are fellowlike creatures, and eaſie to be diſcipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and thus they aſſembled in great numbers round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout my lodging along the faire Riuer of <hi>Tanais,</hi> bearing honour and obedience to me.</p>
            <p>The other part of my pleaſure and daily paſtime was to tame manie wilde horſes (which in that Region are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent) and to exerciſe my ſelfe in hunting and ſhooting: whereby I ſlewe great numbers of Beares, Bulls, Buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles, wilde Bores, Harts, Lyons, Panthers, rauening Wolues, Pardalides, Muſtells, Powle catts and other beaſts of moſt faire and ſoft ſkin, whereof there was great numbers, and cauſed them to be fleaed, dreſt and perfumed by two of my men, who could both doo it verie well, &amp; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne others. Of theſe faire ſkins I cauſed braue apparell to be made for my Ladie <hi>Priſcaraxe</hi> (who before was clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:176416:50"/>onely in linnen) of ſo proper a faſhion, that they ſet foorth the faireſt of her humanitie outwardly, as the necke, the breaſt, and wriſts:
<note place="margin">The firſt in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uention of trained gownes, &amp; cauſes why.</note>but beneath her girdle they couered al the reſt of her lower parts, with an ample ſtole hanging downe to the ground before, and with a long trayne tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on the ground behinde, and couering her ſerpenticall tayle: in ſuch ſort that thoſe rude and ſimple people apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued nothing, being giuen to vnderſtand that this long trayne behinde the garment was a marke and token of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minine nobleneſſe, which was meaſured according to the length of the tayle; which opinion remained yet vnto this day. Theſe braue garments thus made of ſo faire and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable ſkins, and ioyned and laced together with rich but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons, coſtly chaines, claſpes of golde, and precious ſtones, gaue to <hi>Prriſcaraxe</hi> an admirable ornament of beautie, with increaſe of authoritie and opinion of nobilitie, coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring her lower ſerpenticall parts ſo honeſtly, whereon ſhee b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>re and turned her ſelf ſo cunningly and ſo eaſely, that ſhe ſéemed to treade little inferiour to a young and want on wench; and thereon would encline her ſelfe at pleaſure in low reuerence and humilitie to whom and where it apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained: and likewiſe to raiſe her ſelfe right of ſtature more high than the common ſort, as it did become her, which got her great maieſtie and dignitie, yea opinion of diuinitie. Hauing thus adorned her with habits &amp; honour, I aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled al the people in a large medow round about me (who degan alreadie to be ſomewhat ciuill) and at the ſound of certaine muſicall inſtruments which my men had, manie others deſcended from the mountaines as yet halfe wilde, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

On the contrarie ſide, if you plucke vp, contrarie, and outrage one another, you ſhall be made a proy to them, and your bodies their paſture, and meate for the blacke and rauening birds of the Heauens. For by accord little things become great, and through diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord the great doo leſſen, periſh and fall to nought. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore aboue all things I admoniſh you to ciuill ſocietie, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, faith truly holden, mutual amitie, euiting of outrage, puniſhing of the offenders by equitable iuſtice, the conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatrix of your common wealth.

Chooſe therefore among you the beſt, wiſeſt, and the moſt vpright which you think to be in the multitude, and preſent him to me mounted; whom after I haue informed of his office, I will (with your conſent) eſtabliſh and crowne him King.</p>
            <p>At this anſwere, the poore <hi>Tartarians</hi> remained ſad and ſorrowfull: neuertheles they aſſembled themſelues in 24. bands, and out of euerie band (after conſultation) was ſent one man to ſpeake for al: ſo were there found 24. excellent men aboue all others, in perſon, ſpeach, and ſpirite; who méeting together to communicate the will of the people, they were found all (a great maruell and ſigne of accord) of one aduice, that is to ſay, to referre to me the election of their King, whom they would hold firme, ſtable, and inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olable: affirming and ſwearing thereto by the winde, &amp; by their <hi>Acinac,</hi> which after their vſage is as much to ſay, as <hi>By life and death.</hi> Hauing thus heard the relation &amp; dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe 24. I thanked them and the whole multitude for the good opinion they had of my iudgement. Then ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing on my féete with the fair <hi>Priſcaraxe</hi> whom I held by the right hand to the ſight of all the people, with a lowde voyce I began as followeth.</p>
            <p>Ye men of <hi>Scythia,</hi> ſéeing you referre to me the honour of this election, and haue ſo inſtantly deſired me beeing a ſtraunger for your King; for both which I thanke you: knowe that I will giue you a King in ſéed extract from my bloud, whom as yet neuer mortal man hath ſéene; together with a Quéene of your countrey and generation: that is, this preſent yong Ladie <hi>Priſcaraxe,</hi> of ſuch forme &amp; beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie as you ſée. (At theſe words
<hi>Priſcaraxe</hi> enclined her ſelfe lowe bending her tayle in ſigne of humble thankes, with right agréeable modeſtie: then with a ſodain turne of<pb n="94" facs="tcp:176416:52"/>her taile, ſhe raiſed vp her ſelfe in moſt high forme, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting euen the Giantlie height of <hi>Franc-Gal</hi> himſelf, which gaue her great apparance of royall maieſtie). And to the end (quoth I) you eſteeme not her originall nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſmall: knowe that ſhe is extract and borne of your land and countrie (which is not ſmall, vnleſſe you eſteeme your natiue ſoyle ſmall) and ſhe is engendred of <hi>Phoebus,</hi> whom you ſo much honour and worſhip: ſhe hath likewiſe an il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrat ſpirit of vnderſtanding, and ſhe is illuminated with a moſt cleere prudence, and ſhall iuſtlie and wiſelie rule and gouerne you: her name is <hi>Priſcaraxe,</hi> the ſignification whereof you may well vnderſtand what it importeth. And if you deſire a man king, knowe ye that in her and within her bodie you haue one engendred by me (whom you haue ſo required) extract from the moſt auncient and illuſtrate bloud of the <hi>Macrobians:</hi> who, in my iudgement will not foreligne his father. And therefore ſo ſoone as he ſhall bée borne, (if peraduenture I be not returned hether againe, as I hope I ſhall) I pray you and ordaine that you call him <hi>Alector:</hi> and that you take and crowne him with this Helmet to him deſtined. And therewithall I ſhewed them a verie little creſt of a Helmet, decked with faire Rubies which was ordeined for <hi>Alector:</hi> &amp; foorthwith I brought out a rich Crowne of gold, wrought with flowers, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched with gemmes of all illuſtrate colours, in ſaying vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them; behold the royall Crowne prepared by my will, and with good iudgement for my Ladie <hi>Priſcaraxe</hi> heere preſent, a moſt faire, wiſe, and noble woman, daughter to <hi>Phoebus,</hi> extract out of your land and countrie, and being now great with a man childe engendred by

Wee accept her (anſwered all the multitude with one crie) we accept her and take <hi>Priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caraxe</hi> for our Queene and Soueraigne Ladie. Then lifted I vp the Crowne on high in the ſight of them all, and ſo eaſilie ſet it vpon the comelie head of the faire
<hi>Priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caraxe,</hi>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:176416:52"/>whoſe haires were according to the Crowne, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that more naturallie they were browned, creſped, and chaungeable: which being by her gratiouſlie receiued, ſhe humblie abaſed her ſelfe by turning her taile, and after that aroſe vp ſtraight and higher than of cuſtome in heroycall reſtance with viſage full of maieſtic; neuertheleſſe amiable and gracious: ouer and aboue her naturall beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, ſhe was attaint with a comelie red ſhamefaſtneſſe ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uated by the fire of modeſtie, intermingled with ioye, and and lightened aboue with the glittering ſplendor of golde, and the gemmes of the rich crowne ſet vppon her head: wherby her forme appeared to the Aſſiſtants ſo faire, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirelike, and almoſt diuine, that euerie one as it were moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with one ſelfe ſpirite cried out, <hi>

<hi>Priſcaraxe</hi> liue, &amp; welcome be the fruite of her bodie, the future King <hi>Alector.</hi>
               </hi> Thus cried the whole multitude at the crowning of <hi>Priſcaraxe</hi> ſo high, that the aier, moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, hills, dales, valleyes, and flouds ringed again with the reſonant reclaime of

Whereto all incontinentlie obayed, and firſt of all the

<hi>Priſcaraxe,</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing others example to doo the like; who refuſed it not, but willingly &amp; with a good heart came to doo homage to their new Quéene: bringing with them in ſigne of honor, ſome boughes from the trées, ſome garlands of ſauage flowers, ſome branches of the vineyeard, others wheaten eares, &amp; bunches of gréene graſſe: which they ſtrowed rounde<pb n="96" facs="tcp:176416:53"/>about their faire Queene: inſomuch that the whole plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme was ſtrowed, and the Queen all couered with wilde ſaffron and other flowers of the medow, which verie gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly ſhe receiued, and after the homages done, ſhe aroſe in excellent ſtraightneſſe, and made them this oration no leſſe ſhort than ſweete.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Scythian Tartarians,</hi> ſithence at your requeſt the moſt noble Prince <hi>Franc-Gal</hi> hath conſtituted and crowned vs Queene of this Region, of you the Inhabitants therein, and of all that which is in your ſubſtaunce, bodies &amp; goods: like as you haue called and taken vs for your Queene, ſo doo we receiue you for faithfull men and good ſubiects, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing you Iuſtice amongſt your ſelues, &amp; defence againſt all your enemies, by the grace and wiſedome giuen vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Soueraigne, by the commandement and counſel of my Lord <hi>Franc-Gal,</hi> and by the forces and aides of our mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, that is of all of you in generall, conditionally that you keepe your plighted faith to vs, which being the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Iuſtice, entertaineth and encreaſeth the ſocietie &amp; fellowſhip of men. At this concluſion euerie one bent their knees and heads in ſigne of reuerence and obedience, and beeing riſen, lift vp vp their heads and hands in ſigne of good will and readineſſe to doo the commandement of their Queene, &amp; ſoueraigne Ladie. Hereupon I cauſed to come before me and the Queene, the
24. chief men who were the faireſt, ſtrougeſt, moſt burlieſt, the beſt and aſſented and ſpeached in the whole multitude, and who had the gifts &amp; grace moſt abundantly: and demaunded of them if they would not willingly employ their liues for the defence of their Countrey, Common wealth, royal Iuſtice, and of the faith &amp; homage which they had promiſed to their Queene? wherevnto all with one conſent anſwered, that willingly they would. Then cauſed I them to giue their faith bare headed, and kneeling in the hand of the Queene: which being receiued with othe of obedience, to ſuſtaine &amp; defend her towards and againſt al: ſhe gaue to each of them a ring<pb n="97" facs="tcp:176416:53"/>of golde in ſigne of the honour of Knighthood, which they receiued anon after, and about their necks I put a coller of golde, whereat a Sunne of golde hung; ſaying vnto them I doo ennoble you, be ye noble men, you and your poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for euer: conditionally that you commit no treaſon or fellonie againſt your Soueraigne. Wherefrom they all anſwered that they would kéepe themſelues, and thanked me humbly for their enobliſhing, and of the honorable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents receiued of me and the Quéene, vowing their bodies and liues for her and me. And all this was done vpon the <hi>Pretoire</hi> of <hi>Gazons</hi> in open ſight and regard of all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who from far beheld this myſterie knowing not what it was, nor to what ende, and meruailed all thereat, finding it notwithſtanding verie faire, &amp; hoped aſmuch to be done and giuen to them: but the common and ancient Prouerb ſaith, <hi>Not all, nor by all, nor to all;</hi> and therefore I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to ſeperate themſelues in ſmall companies by
9. and 9. and to place them in the medowe, and the 24, round about the
<hi>Pretoire:</hi> which willingly they did, &amp; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed themſelues by 9. and 9. in a companie. Being thus ordeiued, I ſent to euerie fellowſhip a quarter of roaſted veniſon, 3. loaues of bread, and a great wooden tankard full of wine, made with grapes, honnie, and water: declaring to them, that it was the firſt liberalitie of the Quéene to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them at her coronation, &amp; inuiting them to be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and make good chéere: which they did, as alſo the 24. no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men which were about the

Which the mother ſéeing knewe not what to doo, either to breake this lumpe to take out the naked childe which ſhe long deſired, and whereunto motherly loue ſollicited her, or els to leaue it whole for feare of hurting the fruit within it, which mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall feare forbad her. Wherefore at length ſhe concluded to let nature worke: and for that cauſe ſhe kept it alwayes in naturall heate neare to her bodie and naked fleſh, and in the moſt hot and couert places; in the night ſhée put it in her bed, and in the day vnder her furres, vntill the end of nine dayes, that in holding it betwéene the palmes of her hands (which are of moſt temperate heate) and warming it with her breath, beholding ſtill the encloſed: ſodainely it began to vnfould the members, ſtretching out the bodie, armes, and legges, and to turne round, in ſuch ſort that it brake the ſhell wherein it was encloſed, and ſo came foorth into the hands of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mother, who receiued with great ioy this child twiſe borne, crying in the infants voyce for the new ſent of the ayre, at the voyce whereof the two familiar damoſels <hi>Piſte</hi> and <hi>Siope</hi> came in, who tooke it and waſhed it with water and wine luke warme: and being once waſhed, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared ſo faire as it was merueilous to behold, &amp; ſo white as ſnowe, with frizled haires as yellow as gold, the bodie great and ſtrong as it were of the age of three yeares, ſtrayning it ſelf, and incontinently going alone: and which is more, it began to laugh and play with the damoſels, and ſo ſoone as it ſaw the Sunne it lift vp the head and eyes, in knowledge of his mothers Syre, and ſaluted it by and by with loud voyce: but ſomewhat liſping in ſinging theſe words, I <hi>ſalute thee.</hi> Whereat the Quéene and damſels<pb n="104" facs="tcp:176416:57"/>began to laugh hartely, although they were verie much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſhed thereat: the rather for that hee was borne booted with buſkins of ſiluered ſkales and ſpurred with gilded ſpurs, in token that he ſhould be a magnanimious knight. And it is verie like, that for ſo much as he was borne with ſuch armes, that nature (for not hurting the body of his mother) had prouided this ſhelly veſſell to emloſe him withall. Who after he was clenſed, hée was brought and rendred to his mother, who receiued him with great ioy, and remembring the name which his father had ordeyned, called him after this maner; <hi>Alector</hi> faire child, the Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne encreaſe in thée vertue, honor, liberalitie, hardines, and proweſſe, for of beautie thou haſt not fayled: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall ſhée kiſſed him right tenderly. The Childe as it were vnderſtanding her voyce, began right gratiouſly to ſmile, and by a ſwéete laughter began to acknowledge his mother, who cauſed to call and aſſemble the 24. knights, with a ſufficient number of the common people, to whome ſhée ſhewed the faire childe, declaring to them that it was conceiued by <hi>Franc-Gal,</hi> whereof they were all glad; and accepted him for their King to come, and for that cauſe in their preſence, put vpon his head y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vermilio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> crowne which <hi>Franc-Gal</hi> had left for him, which becommed him the moſt propereſt that might be, and he planted it ſo naturallie on his head, that it neuer after from thence departed. After this the Quéene preſented him her vermillion nib of her white dug, that he might ſuck, but he obſtinately refuſed it; and when ſhe would inſtantly haue applied the end there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to his mouth, he turned away his face, and began to crie aloude this <hi>Phrigian</hi> word <hi>Beco, beco,</hi> which is as much to ſay as bread, bread: then did they preſent him bread, which he eate together with roſted fleſh, with a good appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, and likewiſe both chéeſe and fruite; and dranck without difficultie both milke, and wine of honey. Wherefore from that day forwards, hee was noriſhed with whole meates. wherewith he grew and fortified ſo great, membrous, and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:176416:57"/>ſtrong, that he grew thrée time ſo much as other children, in ſuch ſort that at ſiue yeares end hee was as corpulent, puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and right of his members, and as prudent and aduiſed in his ſpirit, as though hee had béen fiftéene yéeres fully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat. And from that time, he began to tame horſes, to runne the hart, to hunt the wilde boare, to breake lances againſt the ground, to ſkirmiſh, wraſtle, vault, leap, throw the bar and ſtone, to runne the ſtade, ſwim in the water, to aſſault and clime high trées and walls; in ſuch ſort that of all the young ſquires of 20. yeares age there was not his match, although hée had not full ſixe; chiefely in hardines of enterpriſe: nor more vertuous in franchiſe &amp; liberalitie, eſpecially towards the damoſels of the Quéene, and all other young and faire maides and women: towards whom he began alreadie to be ſo enclined and giuen, that he could not bée withdrawne their companie; ſo addicted was he to preſent the humble ſeruice of his gentle perſon to young and faire damoſels and other maides and women: yea and by reaſon of the entier familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie which hée had with his mother (being one of the faireſt exeatures in the world) he aſſayd to returne to the place, from whence he was iſſued. Which thing the Quéene perceiuing, and fearing leaſt his ouer hardy youth through ignorant ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie ſhould doo ſome outrage to honour and nature, like a moſt wiſe woman, determined to reare him out of his neſt, and to ſend him into ſome place where he might finde me.</p>

But he holpe himſelfe ſo well, with his flat féet and with his ſtrong and puiſſant tayle, ruling the torment of the waues that he ſaued both himſelf and vs, who were trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling with feare of the preſent death hanging ouer our heads. And albeit theſe tempeſtuous ſprites did ſo charge him with al their force that they made him to abate &amp; ſtrike his wings, and ſo tormented, heated, and altred him, that hee was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to drinke, wherby he became (according to his nature as hath béen ſaid) more dangerous, furious, vntractable, and perilous, inſomuch y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> what w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> force of ſodaine leapings, rude flingings, prompt windings, &amp; often riſings, hee had almoſt drouned vs in the

And then came to my memory the auncient lady <hi>Anange</hi> who by viue imagination aduiſed mee to beare vp the cierge giuen mée by <hi>Cleronome,</hi> &amp; lightned by
<hi>zodore.</hi> The which hauing reared on high, &amp; ventiled to make it burne more high and cleere I might behold two celeſtial lights, procéeding from the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, to come &amp; ioyne w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> my light: by vertue of that which toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with mine endeuor, knowledge, &amp; ſtrength al this wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed &amp; wandring ſprits, ayry and watry, al aduerſe and trauerſe winds, flotes, waues, hoyſtings, ſinkings, thunders, light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings tempeſts &amp; al other torments departed at an inſtant, &amp; returned to the tops of thoſe <hi>Acrocerean</hi> mountains, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as yet they rage, &amp; diueliſhly lighte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: wherby they are called of nauigators the hils of diuels. Theſe wicked ſpirits retired in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their <hi>Acroceranicall</hi> caſtles, the Sea in the ſpace of two houres being ſetled, became ſo tranquil, calme, quiet and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall, that it ſéemed nothing but a field of glaſſe; ſauing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> on the top thereof floated the neaſts of ſome Sea birds, builded cloaſed, and enterlaced with vigne twigs and eares of corne, by ſuch naturall architecture, that with paine could a man
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:176416:59"/>break them with the blowes of a hatchet, &amp; of ſuch faire and artificiall building that no baſketmaker or topiarie workman could faſhion the like. And this was in the time of the <hi>Brume</hi> about the
14. of <hi>December</hi> and wintrie <hi>Solſtice</hi> when the Sunne entreth the Tropick of <hi>Capricorne;</hi> wherby I knew that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> birds ſwimming in thoſe faire neſts were called <hi>Halcy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ones,</hi> who in this time doo build, couer, and hatch their yong: to which birds, nature hath granted thus much grace and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge, that for the ſpace of 14. dayes, the waters and winds ſéeme to obay them, and in this time (which is the ſoreſt part of winter) to appeaſe their rigor, and to moderate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, in ſuch peaceable tranquilitie, that the ayre and Seas are in reſt, and perigrinations ſure, which I think to be done by a ſecret fauour of nature to this little bird; whereat I was much ameruailed, &amp; could not finde the cauſe for what vtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie either of the world, or of this creature: the moſt wiſe Lady dame <hi>Nature</hi> was ſo fauorable to theſe little birds, as in this peruerſe time to giue them y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tranquilitie, which ſhe refuſeth to affoord vnto me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; which to my thinking is vnworthily done. Wherefore eleuating my cierge higher to conſider the cauſe more metaphyſicallie, I ſuppoſed the cauſe of this tranquili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, to be the returne of the Sonne (who is the moſt illuſtrate Lord, and ruler of the inferiour things) into the Tropick of <hi>Capricorne.</hi> But as I was reſoluing on this poynt, behold a voyce which ſéemed to iſſue out of the mouth of my horſe, ſaying:
<q>
                  <l>Tis not as thou doſt think, <hi>Franc-Gal,</hi> this calme &amp; quiet ſpace</l>

                  <l>Who in the time of quiet reſt into this world muſt come.</l>
                  <l>To bring to them th'eternall peace, that will receiue the ſame</l>
                  <l>With ioy; or els refuſe it to their owne confuſed ſhame:</l>
                  <l>Ne yet is this tranquilitie in fauour or respect</l>
                  <l>Of this ſmall bird, who by foreſight this calme doth not neglect</l>
                  <l>To cloſe &amp; hatch her tender yong, when ſtormy winds do ceaſe,</l>
                  <l>To ſhow that wealth doth moſt abound in time of reſt &amp; peace,</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="109" facs="tcp:176416:59"/>Inquire therefore no higher cauſe, ne make no more a doo:</l>

               </q> And hereupon the voyce ceaſed, which ſéemed to procéed out of the throte of my horſe: whereat I was ſore abaſhed and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhed, and for that cauſe I demanded and ſaide, how com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth it to paſſe <hi>Durat,</hi> and when and where haſt thou lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſpeake and prophecie? But he anſwering me not one word, turned his head toward the Weſt, and tooke his direct courſe with enlarged féet, and wings hoyſted vp, ſo that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a while I arriued at the ports of <hi>Dalmace</hi> and <hi>Sclauonia</hi> in Illyrica, and ſo paſſing through the vnſatiable throtes of <hi>Scilla</hi> and

In reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pence wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I returned from them loaden with honours, graces, rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, preſents, ſubſtance, and victuals; wherewith I charged my good horſe <hi>Durat</hi> for the prouiſion of my voyage.</p>
            <p>Now as I was repoſing my ſelfe, one day arriued a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger come towards me on the behalfe of the Quéene <hi>Priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caraxe,</hi>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:176416:60"/>who had followed, and ſought me by ſea and land con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually and all places, demanding <hi>Franc-Gal</hi> the great old knight vpon the flying and ſwimming horſe, of whom he had heard newes in al places by euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t tokens, yet neuertheles he had erred &amp; wandred by ſea two whole yéeres before he could méet me: vatil ſuch time as I arreſting at <hi>Cales</hi> he had means to finde me, where he preſented me letters of credit ſent by the Quéene <hi>Priſcaraxe</hi> conteining partly y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which before I haue reckoned to thée, without forgeting y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faire child <hi>Alector</hi> who was twiſe borne, the maner how, &amp; his ſuddaine grouth: but aboue all things ſhee ſent mee word, how that ordinarily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding euery day and houre, the ring which I had left with her, wherein was ſet the changeable <hi>Carbuncle,</hi> oftentimes ſhe had found it ſomewhat changed, one while being pale, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother while darke, another while clere &amp; ſhining: but that in the 4. yeare of my departure the 14. of the Moneth of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember (which was the day wherein I was tormented in the gulfe of the Diabolicall mountaines) in beholding my ring, ſhe perceiued it very pale, aſhy, &amp; almoſt extinct of all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> light. And thereupon ſhe had diſpatched this meſſenger to go ſéeke me through all ſeas &amp; lands, &amp; to enquire of my health, well doing, &amp; fortunes; and to reckon to me hers, ſuch as had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to her ſince my departure, requiring me right affectuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to returne ſhortly. And for that ſhe willed me to giue faith and credit to the words of the bearer, very curiouſly I aſked him of ſuch things, as had hapned ſince my departure: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to he anſwered me very aſſuredly, beginning at the apparitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Protëus</hi> the old man of the ſea, of his prophecie written in the barke of a trée, which he deliuered mee, and is that which thou haſt ſéene, (O
<hi>Archier</hi>) vnderſtood and read. Then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed he me the exerciſes of the knights, the honors, duties and preſents done to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Quéene: her childbirth, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doubble na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuitie of <hi>Alector,</hi> his coronatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nurture, maners &amp; exerciſes, and his ſoddaine aduancement &amp; growing. Whereof I had ſuch ioy at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heart, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I could conceiue no greater. Finally he recounted to me fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> poynt to poynt all things in manner &amp; forme, as I haue made the narration: thus hauing heard al, I cauſed him to reſt himſelf, &amp; made him good chere for certaine
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:176416:60"/>daies. And the whiles I writ an anſwere to my moſt wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beloued <hi>Priſcaraxe,</hi> willing her to maintaine her ſelf alwaies in royall authoritie and maieſtic, with ſure and ioyfull hope of my returne, if death, ſickneſſe or priſon did not let me: ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it was firſt requiſit for me (by force of my deſtinies) to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit and compaſſe the roundnes of land and ſea, vntill ſuch time as by continual going forwards, I was returned to the place where fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I departed, which could not be done ſo ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, praying her the whiles to entertaine her ſelfe with her knights and people, in peace and Iuſtice, in vertue and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, noriſhing and bringing vp her ſonne <hi>Alector</hi> well and nodly, cauſing him diligently do exerciſe all honeſt and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous actions meet &amp; worthie for a young prince, which ſhould be the greateſt pleaſure that I could of her either looke for or receiue. The letter after this tenour cloſed &amp; ſealed, I writ another ſhorter to the 24. Knights in generall, willing and commanding them inuiolately to kéepe their faith and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence promiſed &amp; ſworne to their Quéene
<hi>Priſcaraxe,</hi> to aid &amp; aſſiſt her in the maintenance of Peace &amp; Iuſtice, &amp; honorably to kéep the noble eſtate of Cheuaſry &amp; exerciſe of armes.

<hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lybian</hi> azure (forged by the <hi>Chalybes,</hi> people in

<hi>Barbary,</hi> where by the proper cléerenes and nightlie ſplendor thereof, I diſcouered this kinde of ſerpent. Wherewithall being after my firſt ſléepe awakened, and merueiling to ſée in the ſand ſuch a ſtrange re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moouing lightning, I drew neere it, and beholding it to be a kinde of ſerpent; I ſet my foote on her head and ſlew it: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neuertheſeſſe for all it was ſlaine, yet did not the ſkin thereof loſe the ſplendor, but remained ſhining, albeit not altogether ſo liuely and farre off ſhining, as it did being aliue: yet was it of naturall ſubſtance ſo clere and ſhining that all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the place by two great faddomes were light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and eaſie to be ſéene. Wherefore hauing repoſed there al the night, in the morning I beheld the Adder ſo ſhining by night, and ſéeing the ſkin thereof ſo faire, ſo variable, ſpeck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, barred, and mailed with gold, ſiluer, azure, purple, ſindal, and all other faire collours, I cauſed it to be fleane, clenſed &amp; tanned in the barke of <hi>Caſsia</hi> and Cinamom, and afterwards made thereof a ſcabard for the good and rich ſworde which I ſent to my Sonne <hi>Alector,</hi> with the other preſents: which being laid in cheſts of <hi>Sapin,</hi> I cauſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be put in a little barke well victualed and furniſhed with Marriners, &amp; other things thereto neceſſarie. So giuing to the meſſenger a rich Caſſock of crimſon veluet buttoned with gold, a doublet of yellowe waterie ſilke chamblet, and a hat of <hi>Albany</hi> couered <pb n="113" facs="tcp:176416:61"/>with cléere blew ſilke veluet, brodred and barred with circles in ſnares of loue, and knit ſtrings of thred of gold, with a fair bowe of <hi>Bubalins</hi> horne, and a quiuer of a <hi>Tayzo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</hi> ſkin ful of arrowes, fethered with rauens fethers, I licenſed him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, and ſent the letters &amp; verball anſwere by him, with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement to declare that which he had ſéen of mine eſtate. So departed hee and went his way, and ſayled without any hard encountry, torment, or ill aduenture, till hée arrined in
<hi>Scythia;</hi> where he hauing taken lande, mounted vp into the pallace of the Quéene <hi>Priſcaraxe:</hi> to whom (as I haue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood ſince by my Sonne <hi>Alectors</hi> arriuall with me) hee preſented my letters, preſents, and giftes ſent to her, to <hi>Alec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> and to the
24. Knights, who were aſſembled in the Quéenes chamber to heare newes of <hi>Franc-Gal</hi> (which is I my ſelfe) whom they hold for their Soueraigne. The letters vnderſtood, they accorded very gladly thereunto, and receiued the preſents moſt agréeably: ſpecially <hi>Alector</hi> who could not fill himſelfe with pulling out, beholding and ſhaking his excellent faire ſword. The meſſenger being in the order that I had apparrelled him in, and ready in the audience of all the aſſiſtance, recited all that hee had ſéen and vnderſtood of mée, with the great honors and praiſes of my vertues, proweſſe, worthy reuengances, meritorious liberalities, Iuſtice, &amp; good enſignements, which he heard reported of me through all the places where I had paſſed, and where he had followed mee: whereof they were all moſt glad, ſpecially my Lady
<hi>Priſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raxe,</hi> who, with a ſwéete remembrance mixed with ſorrow and ioy, could not abſteine from weeper;ing inceſſantly before all the knights; who after the meſſage declared, comforted and conſolated her: and ſhe the more to encreaſe her ioy, put the rich double coller of Margarites (which I had ſent her) about her neck, and inuited the 24. Knights to ſupper, who departing from thence, went to arme themſelues in the new harneſſes which I had ſent them, and to put on their ſpurres which they neuer before had vſed, and mounting on horſuark went to Iuſt and proue their new armours, which merueil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly pleaſed them, aſwel for the brightnes of the burniſhed<pb n="114" facs="tcp:176416:62"/>yron flaming like the ſonne, as alſo for the ſound and clatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the harneſſe, and for the beautie of the helmets and ſhields painted and guilded. But if there were no man to whome theſe habillements of ſuch hard and impenetrable y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, and of ſuch refulgent ſplendor, ſéemed braue: yet was <hi>Alector</hi> cleane rauiſhed with admiration, in ſuch ſort that forgetting all wantonnes and loue, he deſired nothing more, than to be made Knight, to the end he might weare ſuch war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like habits, and ſee himſelfe once armed and mounted on horſeback, garniſhed with ſhielde and ſpeare, as for a ſworde he could haue no fairer nor better, than that which I had ſent him. In theſe thoughts and deſires <hi>Alector</hi> beheld the Knights, being al armed in white, and to proue their ſpurres began to prick their horſes, who (being not long before ſauage, neuer accuſtomed to bee tickled in that order) began to runne with the bridle betwéene their teeth, to fling, and leape ſo rudely that a man could ſée nothing in the Meadowe but Knights abated to the earth and vnbridled horſes run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning through the field. Notwithſtanding they mounted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>game, and pricking their horſes more moderatly, accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med them by little and little to the ſpurre and bridle. So Iuſted they certaine houres, and fought with ſwords, hatchers of armes and clubs, bauing moſt great pleaſure to heare their hard armor ſo to ſound, and to giue one another ſuch great blowes without burt. Thus Iuſting and fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſpace for their exerciſes, euerie one went to diſarrue himſelfe, and afterwards came all to ſupper into the pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late where the Queene made them right good and ioyfull chéere. And after much talke at ſupper held of mee, of my liveralitie towards them, and of the beautie and bountie of the armes wherewithall I had garniſhed them, in whoſe brighenes they beheld their valour, as Ladies doo their beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in Chriſtall glaſſes: vppon ſure confidence therein, they enterpriſed and expedition to goe make Warre vppon the monſterous and fearce beaſts kéeping their Caues in the Mount <hi>Imaus,</hi> who from day to day iſſuing out of their hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe <pb n="115" facs="tcp:176416:62"/>rockes ſpoyled their cattell, and deſtroyed their flockes: and from thence to paſſe the foreſaid mount of <hi>Imaus</hi> to fight with the Giants of <hi>India:</hi> who oftentimes accuſtomed to enter vpon their marſhes, and to rauiſh their fayre wiues and children. And vpon this concluded deliberation (which afterwards was accompliſhed) euerie one retyred himſelfe to reſt. But
<hi>Alector</hi> who had gotten the flea in his eare, with the deſire which he had to be made Knight, and to beare fayre white harneſſe, could not ſléepe: for, the gneying of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, the bruit of armour, the clattering and bruſing of lances, and the blowes and ſtrokes of ſwords, which hee thought alwaies to heare, awakened him vnceſſantly; neither did hee ought but ſtudie whether hee might depart before day without taking leaue of his mother to goe ſéeke out <hi>Franc-Gal</hi> his Father, whoſe renowme pricked him forward more than any other thing: but conſioering on the other ſide that it ſhould bee villanie and diſhonour to himſelfe, and griefe to the Quéene his carefull Mother: Motherlie pittie and naturall honeſtie willed him to demand lycence of her, which hee hoped (his intent conſidered) ſhould not be deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him: and vpon this reſolution hee ſlept till the morning; which being come he ſpéedily aroſe and appareled himſelfe, and ſo came againſt the riſing of the Quéene to giue her the <hi>Boniour,</hi> and in humble reuerence preſenting himſelfe to her on his knées, hée began his pretended ſuite in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>

<hi>Armenia</hi> to the foote of a mountaine, where hée tooke land: and after hee had ſhaken his eares, maine, taile, and whole body to caſt of the water, he began to neigh aloud. At this neighing two rauening Wolues deſeended from the mountaines ſéeking their pray vpon the neighing beaſt, and with wide and open throate, threatned nothing but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure him, howling moſt horribly. The horſe naturallie knowing his enemies, began to ſnort and fling furiouſly, in ſuch ſort that he ſtroke one of the wolues which would haue faſtned on him behinde &amp; haue lopen vpon his croup, whiles the other aſſailed him before. But the gentle horſe, ſéeing the one, and feeling the other, gaue ſuch a fling with his two heeles againſt his breſt, ſo rudelie, that he ſent him ſtre foote back to the earth, amaſed, with his ſides brooſed. And with that rude fling it behoued <hi>Alector</hi> to fall to the ground: who fearing more his horſe than his owne perſon, aroſe ſpéedilis with his good ſword naked in his hand, and preſented himſelf<pb n="123" facs="tcp:176416:66"/>before the great rauening wolfe, who perceiuing him, left the horſe, and flew vpon

Where with all the beaſt being enraged, began hideouſly to howle, and ſo as <hi>Alector</hi> (thinking that hee had ſlaine the beaſt) ſlooped downe to take vp his hat to couer his head, the rauening Wolfe through mortall rage caught him by the arme which he had naked, with his ſharp teeth, ſo ſtraightly, that with the paine hee felt, almoſt his heart had failed him: but his noble hardines cauſed him to take courage, whereby he gaue ſuch a thruſt with his ſworde into the body and heart of the beaſt, that with the iſſuing of the bloud his life depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and force failed: his téeth notwithſtanding remaining in
<hi>Alectors</hi> arme, through mortall conuniſion ſo faſlned, that hee could not recouer it from the dead beaſt, hauing but one hand wherewith to help himſelfe. His horſe on the other part had ſo trampled the other Wolfe with his forefeete, ſo beaten him with his hinder heeles, and ſo preſſed his neck with fayre teeth, that he had made an ende of killing him, the Wolfe lying dead ſtretched out vpon the earth, and the horſe afterwards ſnorting and neighing. At the noyſe whereof iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued a fiſherman out of his houſe which was thereby; becauſe he got his liuing with catching of fiſh vpon the riuer, with nets, hookes, and a little boate. This good fiſherman ſéeing theſe two rauening Wolues dead, was merueilouſly aſtoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed at the valure which he ſawe to be in ſo young a perſon, and ſore compaſſioned of the euill which hee ſaw him ſuffer. Wherefore he approached nere him with ſalutation and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſpeach, and by force of his hands, and ſtrokes of a betle vpon the iawes of the Wolfe, and with a knife which he had<pb n="124" facs="tcp:176416:67"/>abouthin, het opeaed the téeth of the Wolfe, and deliuered the arme of

In the meane while an olde wife which hee had, put ſome fiſh into the pot to boyle, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome vppon the gridion to roaſt: then ſpread ſhee on the ground a large Hearts ſkin cut round, and ſet there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Barlie Bread reaſonable white, baked vppon a tyle, with dried Rayſins and Apples, with Wine made of Hony and water, enuiting ſimplie their Gueſt to eate and drinke; whereto hee accorded moſt willingly as one that had neede thereof. Whereupon they ſat downe with their leggs a croſſe about this fayre table cloth without ſeame, where the olde wift ſerued them with boyled and roſted fiſh, and with ſtore of fruite. So they eate and dranke at their eaſe, deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the adueuture, and how the impetuous flood had carried him, vnknowing in what country hee was. The Fiſherman tolde him that he was at the foote of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of

As touching the fact, hee ſpake troth, for in my voyage by Sea, coaſting the riuages: all the mouthes of the Riuers which I founde, I was accuſtomed to enter them, to ſée and knowe the Townes and Countries lying there about in the continent: whereby it happened that paſſing the <hi>Perſian</hi> gulph alongeſt <hi>Arabia,</hi> and view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the mouthes of this fayre Riuer
<hi>Tygre</hi> falling into the Sea, I entred into the ſame, and ſo mounted againſt the ſtreames. And by fortune apperceiuing a Carauanne of
<hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian</hi> theeues and robbers, who vnder the conduct of a puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and valtant (but a wicked) Knight, enfeſted the whole Countrey. In ſo much that hauing vnderſtood the popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar complaints, I landed with my men (whereto thoſe théeues had likewiſe fainedly enuited vs, to rob and ſpoyle vs) and ſo ſet vpon this Cauaille &amp; euill harneſſed company with ſuch hardines and exployt, that of a great nomber of them, there remayned but fiue, who ſaued themſelues by flight, and wee purſued them to Mount

Wherefore with a great ſtroak of my ſword, I cloue his head in twaine, and then hong I vp their armes &amp; the ſhield aboue them all, vpon an old trée which was in that place in the forme of a Trophie: &amp; cauſed the valiant Knight to be buried at the foote therof, who through obſtination to my great grief had cauſed himſelf to he ſlaine. And ſo for that time we purged the countrie. This done, one night I returned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the

And for that he had found the ſléeues which was made of the ſkin of the Wolfes leg to be very fayre, and wel beſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming him (for hee had his armes naked, for ſo much as the<pb n="126" facs="tcp:176416:68"/>ſléeues of his coate did not couer him, but were open and hanging by like a coate of armes) he required the fiſherman to flea the other leg for his right arme, and to flea and giue him both the ſkins of the Wolfes, which the good man moſt willingly performed: and <hi>Alector</hi> more willingly arcepted them and thereof made fayre bardes for his horſe, ſaying that he had well merited to haue part of the ſpoyle, for that he had béen participate of the danger, and done his dutie in the fight. Wherein this yong youth well declared that he was come of a franke and noble nature and birth: hauing thus harneſſed and barded his horſe with theſe fayre ſkins of the rauening Wolfe, hee mounted vpon him and tooke leaue of his hoſte; hauing vnderſtood that I had gained the heigth he determined to follow me, and to mount vp againſt the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous riuer of <hi>Tygre,</hi> not by the rauiſhing way which had ſo carried him away, but by the ſureſt way of the land. And rode ſo long by many iournies, that one day at Sonne going downe he found himſelfe at the foote of one ſide of the mount <hi>Caucaſus</hi> in a plaine deuided into thrée high waies: where was a place of reaſonable ſpace &amp; ample enough, and in the mids a Trophie erected vpon the body and branches of a great olde and dead tree, charged with all ſorts of harneys, Launces, ſwords, and ſhields. In contemplation whereof, <hi>Alector</hi> who had a ſingular pleaſure in armes, alighted, let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his horſe feede on the fayre graſſe which was about the trée, and with great contemplation began to behold theſe ſorts of armes hanging vppon the Trophie of the tree. But aboue all the reſt, his eyes following his affection, were moſt fixed vpon one fayre and great ſhield made in forme of an egge and couered with a plate of braſſe whereon was ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uated a Cock of gold, armed and ſpurred with Gules in a damaſked field of greene ſynople, the Cock being raiſed on his tiptoes, beating his wings, and looking vp a loft. This ſhield ſo pleaſed this young <hi>Alector</hi> (as youth is delighted with ſuch pleaſant pictures) that he concluded to take it off and carrie it away for the couerture and ornament of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as alſo he would haue done the other armes, but that hee<pb n="127" facs="tcp:176416:68"/>fame them ouer great for the corpulence of his age: as alſo for that he had béen aduertiſed, that to put on harneſſe before he was knighted, appertained not vnto him. Wherefore conſidering that he was but an Eſquire to whome it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to carrie a ſhield, as armes of defence and not of offence; and ignorant that the Trophies are inuiolable like to <hi>Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chres,</hi> through ſimple affection and deſire, mounted vpright on his horſe, and reaching as high as he could with the poynt of his ſworde tooke downe the ſhield which hong on the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of the ſhield, his horſe apperceiuing a fayre fountaine run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at the foote of the mountaine amongſt a ſort of trees, and being a thirſt of his daily trauell, ſtole away from vnder his maſter to goe drinke, wherewithall <hi>Alector</hi> fell downe with his naked ſword in his hand and the ſhteld after him. And at the ſame inſtant he might heare a great laughter of one who mocked him with open throate. Whereby thinking that there had béen ſome body hid there about, who with laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing had mocked him at his fal, he ſodainly aroſe, put the ſhield about his neck and the ſworde in his hand (as he was of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture cholerik enough and proude, and as glorious of ſodaine riſing as ſhamefull of his fall) with a fierce and long voyce, ſayde: what art thou that laugheſt, and mockeſt me in ſecret, as though it were at a lubber, for being falne not of féeble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes or ill attempt, but by the ſtealing away of my horſe who hild me vp. Laugh not, nor mock not, but onely come and ſhowe thy ſelfe in place, and thou ſhalt be very highly moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted if I lay thee not a long more rudely than I my ſelfe am falne. At theſe words the other began to laugh more louder than before: wherewithall <hi>Alector</hi> being more moued; how commeth it to paſſe (quoth hee) that there is ſuch mockers, in this countrie? Ah villainous mockers, coward and ouer hardy, thou laugheſt, and dareſt not ſhowe thy ſelfe, but I will finde thee well enough, and guard thee well from laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And ſo (ful of impatient indignation) he went ſearching fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one part to another this faire laugher, who ſo much more continued: and when <hi>Alector</hi> was in one place, hee might heare him laugh in another right againſt him: and when hée<pb n="128" facs="tcp:176416:69"/>went the other, it ſeemed that he laughed on the other ſide, ſo as this inuiſible laughter, cauſed him with hot fury to run here and there from one ſide to another, diſpiſing, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, prouoking, and beating the buſhes and brakes with great ſtrokes of his ſword laid on in vaine through diſpitefull wrath, vntill ſuch time as the night ouertooke him being very black and obſcure. Wherefore <hi>Alector</hi> being wearied and trauelled with running and turning, with caſting and fling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his ſtrokes in vaine, as alſo with hunger and thirſt which he had ſuffered a great while, apperceiuing the obſcure night to approach, and fearing to loſe his horſe, bethought him to leaue his laughter, doing him no other harme, neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles threatning and aſſuring him that the next day hee would finde him and make him change his laugbing into weeping; whereat this ridiculous ſpirit (as he was) began yet more louder to laugh and in good earneſt: for <hi>Alector</hi> was well guarded that night from finding his laughter the next day. Seeing therefore that he profited nothing in tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting himſelfe to ſeeke after him, he tooke a Hare which he had ſtroken and flaine in a buſh, thinking that it was his moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, and by the cléerenes of the ſcabbard of his ſword made of the Adders ſkin (as I haue declared before) he followed the trace of his horſe towards the mountaines, while he came to the tuft of trees where he found his horſe laide in the graſſe vp to the belly, eating and repoſing himſelfe by a fayre and cléere fountaine, iſſuing from the foote of the mountaine. Then his choler being paſſed, he ſaid, that his horſe after his kinde was wiſer than himſelfe, who after his labor tooke reſt and food, whereas he trauailed in vaine and hunger. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his ſword put vp into his ſcabbard, and the ſhield (which ſo much pleaſed him) put about his neck, and the thongs ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtraight knit and locked for feare of looſing it: he toke his Hare, flead, &amp; panched her, &amp; then waſhed his hands in the ſpring, and dranke (for with chafing himſelfe with choler and trauell, hee was very thirſty) and ſo hauing pulled his Hare in peeces, eate the fleſh rawe (which was no nouels to him) ſomuch as he pleaſed, and til he was ſatiſcted: then went hée<pb n="129" facs="tcp:176416:69"/>againe to drinke, to waſh his mouth hands and face with the cleere water of the fountaine, and being thus refreſhed hee laid him down vpon his ſhield by his horſe, where being wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie with daylie trauaile, he fell into a profound ſleepe.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Owards midnight as <hi>Alector</hi> was in his moſt proſound ſleepe, him thought hee heard a fearefull voyce, which in frightful wiſe ſaid vnto him: <hi>Alector</hi> thou theefe, theeſe <hi>Alector</hi> and ſacrileger, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore me my ſhield which thou haſt taken and ſtrooken downe from the violated Trophie againſt all right, and after for recompence haſt ſought to beate me with the ſtrokes of the ſword: reſtore it me I bid thee. At theſe words <hi>Alector</hi> wakened with fright, and aroſe in haſte: and ſo hee might apperceiue before him, a great black and fierce Knight with a pale viſage like one who had beene dead long time before: yet neuertheles one foote and armed in all parts with ſome of thoſe armes which hee had ſeene the day before vpon the Trophie, ſaue only that he wanted a ſhield. Which great black Knight, ſaid to him againe thus:
<hi>Alector,</hi> theefe, ſacrileger, and periured, thou haſt robbed mee of my ſhield, polluted &amp; violated the ſacred Trophie: and thou being none other than an Eſquire againſt the vow of nobilitie haſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken armes againſt me, who am or haue been a Knight, ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with all thy power to kill mee: yea thou haſt flaine and<pb n="130" facs="tcp:176416:70"/>(which is worſe) eaten one of my companions of houſh old: and now dooſt thou think to eſcape thus with thy rape and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegious theft? Reſtore mee my ſhield. <hi>Alector</hi> vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding himſelfe thus iniured not in his beard (for beard as yet had he none ſauing that of fleſh and blood) but in his face and viſage, was merueilouſly chafed in his ſkin: yet neuertheles waighing the reaſons of the black Knight (which ſoemed to him not vnreaſonable) like a youth well taught (as he was) anſwered him thus: I haue not ſtolne the ſhield, but haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it openly as a thing publickly abandoned of all men, &amp; in the open ſight of all men which would haue beholden me, yea of the laugher who mocked at my fal, and after hid himſelf. I knowe not whether it were thine owne or not: for if I knew? But well, I am no ſacrileger, at the leaſt wittingly, for I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer knew til now, what a Trophie was: neither whether it were ſacred or prophane, truth it is I haue taken the ſhield, becauſe it ſéemed to mee fayre, and neceſſary for mee and my body, &amp; hanging there vnprofitably vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an old trée, the which notwithſtanding I am ready to render to him, to whome it ſhalbe ſhown me iuſtly to appertaine; otherwiſe not, for it fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth me well. And to ſay that I haue falſified the oath of a noble Eſquire, and committed fellony towards the order of Knighthood; I haue not done it, neither would doo it. Truth it is. I ſought with my ſword a fooliſh laugher, and ſcoffer, who (as it ſéemed to me) mocked at the fault which my horſe made me: which laugher I wel heard, but I could neuer ſee nor finde him: ſauing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in a buſh (where me thought I heard him laugh) with a ſtrokeof my ſword caſt at aduenture I kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a fat Hare, which there was ſet. I knew not whether that Hares laugh in this countrey or no, but this I am ſure of, that I was laughed and mocked at, &amp; that I haue eaten her with a good appetite. As for thy companions which thou ſaiſt I haue ſlaine and eaten: I knowe not who they be, for I neuer ſaw them, vnleſſe they bee Hares, and that thou thy ſelfe art ſome Diuell of a Hare, for thou ſéemeſt to me not much more hardy: and the common ſaying is, that Diuels doo wittingly tranſform the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues by the fields into hares. Wherfore ſhew<pb n="131" facs="tcp:176416:70"/>me thine eares, and tel me what thou art: whether thou be a Hare or a knight, which are verie contrarie. For a knight ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth on horſback and is armed, hardy and valiant, or at leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ought to be: and the Hare goeth on foote, is very ſeare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, &amp; by nature vnarmed of al defence, both of hornes, teeth, clawes, poyſon, hardnes, and all, ſauing of a certaine feareful legerity: which is the cauſe that hee is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſt fearefulleſt beaſt amongſt all other creatures, and a pray to the Eagles of the aire, and dogs of the earth, and Chamarins of the water: yet ſhould he not find it, eſpecially in the dog daies &amp; eleuatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Eagle; wherefore telme if thou be a knight, or a Hare, or a diuel, or the laugher and mocker of whom I would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly reuenge my ſelf if I could méste w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> him. I am no Hare (ꝙ the great black knight) but the hare which thou haſt ſlaine and eaten was my companion; for he kept company with me in my ſepulcher: I am not fearefull (for no man can doo mee more harme) neither was I euer, but haue béen in my time a worthie knight, hardy, &amp; enterpriſing great things, of nature franck &amp; liberal, extract out of the noble linage of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
               <hi>Macrobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> &amp; called <hi>Gallehault,</hi> as witneſſeth my ſhield which thou beareſt, wherein is a Cock regarding high towards heauen, whereby I would ſignifie my high enterpriſes and hardines: and of ſuch vertue is the ſhield that whoſoeuer carrieth it, ſhal neuer haue feare or doubt: &amp; it is that which maketh thée now ſo aſſured againſt me. Now it happened mee thus, that for my great frankeneſſe and exceſſiue liberalitie (which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led prodigalitie) I became very poore, and yet neuertheles I would alwaies maintaine my greatnes and magnificence, for the atchiuing wherof, I was conſtrained for want of mine own to take of other mens. Wherefore hauing aſſembled to me a great company &amp; carrauanne of
<hi>Arabinas,</hi> wicked peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, &amp; apt to do euil, I deſtroyedal this countrie w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> robberies, aſſaults, rauiſhments ſpoylings &amp; thefts, kéeping w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> my men al the waies, corners, and paſſaſſes, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ports of riuers and ſeas, taking away the armes, horſes, rings, iuels, ſtuf, appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, gold, ſiluer, &amp; merchandize of ſuch as we took, ſelling their bodies for ſlaues, or abuſing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> luxuriouſly if they pleaſed vs.<pb n="132" facs="tcp:176416:71"/>Neuertheles this life (whereto proud pouertie had brought me) pleaſed me not, but I had it in abomination: and for that cauſe I determined, that after I ſhould be gotten vp againe inſubſtance, to haue killed all my companion théeues to the end they ſhould doo no more euill, and to retire my ſelfe, and returne to my former honorable, liberall, and leſſe prodigall life. But of this paine, one of my great vncles of the <hi>Macro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians</hi> called <hi>Franc-Gal</hi> which is thy Father, deliuered mee: whom I knowe thou goeſt to ſeeke, and whom I will cauſe thee to ſée to morrow, in recompence of the pleaſure which he did in deliuering mee from the wicked life which I led. For being mounted vppon an <hi>Hypoppotame,</hi> which is a great flying and ſwimming horſe in the Riuer of <hi>Tygre</hi> with ſome companie of valiant men; for ſo much as wee were many mo in nomber, wherein wee truſted, wee inuited them by fayned courteſie to take land and come and reſt with vs, which they did, being aduertiſed before what people we were, and for that cauſe they ſearched vs. Whereupon incontinently as they were deſcended well armed and weaponed, they flong vppon vs with ſuch fury and valour, that notwithſtanding the great reſiſtance which I made, all my
<hi>Arabians</hi> were ſlaine and diſcomfetted by the great proweſſe of
<hi>Franc-Gal,</hi> being halfe a Giant, who ſtroke not a blowe without laying two or three on the ground. So were the takers taken, and the ſpoylers ſpoyled, except foure who through their legeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie fled, and I after them. But that ſaued vs not: for <hi>Franc-Gal</hi> who by ſoueraigne force and naturall agilitie ran faſter than any horſe or hart followed vs not running but flying (as it ſéemed) vnto the place, where not able in haſt to gaine the mountaine, and ſeeing him alone, wee returned fiue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and I my ſelfe more than any other reſiſted him: as for my companions, hee had ſone cut them in peeces; but I hild him tack reaſonable long and hardy enough in the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and couerture of my ſhield deſending my ſelfe with great courage: whereupon he ſeeing my hardines and noble heart, he ſommoned me often times to render: but I being enuious of my wicked life anſwered him, that as then I had neuer<pb n="133" facs="tcp:176416:71"/>bowed, and that it was deerer for me to dye, than either to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire mercie or receiue it. Wherefore he perceiuing my ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination; ah (quoth he) there is none loſt but ſuch as are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate, and in ſaying ſo, hee gaue me ſuch a ſtroake with his ſword, that he cloue my head in twaine. At theſe words the great black Knight plucked off his helmet and ſhowed to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector</hi> his clouen head, in ſuch ſort that one might perceiue the braines conſumed with wormes, then puting on his hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met againe, hee continued his tale, ſaying: with this great ſtroake I fell downe dead: and
<hi>Franc-Gal</hi> vnarmed me and my fellowes alſo, whoſe carcaſes he left as food for the beaſts of the earth and fowles of the ayre: but my body hee cauſed to be buried at the foote of the great withered tree in the med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes her about, and laid a ſtone vpon a graue. Then hung hee vp our armes in the Trophie of the great tree and my ſhield aboue all, which thou haſt taken off, therefore reſtore it mee. <hi>Alector</hi> then anſwered him; <hi>Gallehalt,</hi> ſith that my Lord and Father (as thou thy ſelfe haſt confeſſed) hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered by force of armes the ſhield of thee, thou haſt no more title in it, but by right of heyre, it appertaineth to me who am his ſonne, and for that cauſe willingly I will not for goe it, vnleſſe it be by greater force than mine, but will keepe it ſo long as I can for thy ſake who art my kinſman, and haſt not any more neede thereof: as alſo for the honor of my Father who hath valiantly conquered it, and for the beautie and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue which I ſee and feele to be in it: and therefore goe reſt thy ſelfe in thy ſepulcher, and let me ſléepe in peace. The
<hi>Galle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hault</hi> in a terrible and feareful voyce ſaide vnto him horribly; <hi>Reſtore me my ſhield.</hi> And in ſo ſaying y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great black knight (which was a ſpright in the forme of <hi>Gallehault</hi>) tooke the ſhield with both his hands, which <hi>Alector</hi> had ſurely faſtned and buckled about his ſhoulders, and which the more he hild and embraced. Wherefore this vmbragious black Knight lifted vp the ſhield in the ayre by a certaine force and ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all puiſſance, and carried vp <hi>Alector</hi> alſo who was faſtned to the ſhield, and at an inſtant cauſed him to looſe ground, and raiſed him vp ſo high in the ayre, that his horſe, (which hee<pb n="134" facs="tcp:176416:72"/>might perceiue by the light of the cléere mome, and whom he bewailed to looſe, ſéemed to him but a little Hare lying vpon the graſſe, by reaſon of the farre diſtance and height that the phantaſtical Knight had eleuated him, carrying him through the leſſer region of the ayre by the field, whereat this Eſquire was faſtned &amp; hanging (for it was not lawful for the knight to touch his perſon) cauſing him to trauerſe the ayre and winds, ſtriuing the one againſt the other ſo rudely, that with great paine could hee fetch his winde, for that the ſodaine mouing tooke away the facultie of taking breath: in ſo much that in three or foure howres hée had carried him more then twelue hundred miles from the place where hee had found him: and a little before day he abaſed himſelfe the height of a launce from the ground ouer a fayre green and ſoft meddow, where the black Knight ſhooke the ſhield to ſhake off
<hi>Alector,</hi> but hee had ſo well buckled it, and held it ſo faſt imbraced, as though it had beene borne and vuited with his bodie and armes. And yet neuertheleſſe for all the ſhaking, <hi>Alector</hi> was not a whit aſtoniſhed, but remained aſſured as though hee had beene on firme ground, through vertue of the ſhielde which he would not leaue, ſaying thus.
<q>
                  <l>Or ere I ſhall it leaue, I will be ſlaine:</l>
                  <l>Els with, or on thy back returne againe.</l>
               </q> Hee had not ſo ſoone ſpoken the word, but hee felt the ſhield looſed by the black Knight, and hee fell downe vppon the graſſe all aſtoniſhed, aſwell for the change of the ayre, as for the fall which was reaſonable high. Wherewithall this Spirite of the black Knight who had brought him thether for his good, and who tooke pleaſure to chafe the hot bloud of his hardie youth, began to laugh far greater and louder then euer he did, in the ſame voyce which hee had heard him laugh the day before. Wherewithall <hi>Alector</hi> beeing irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, aroſe on his feete in great anger, ſaying: Hay my
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:176416:72"/>Lord Diuell the laugher: it is then thou gentle
<hi>Gallhea,</hi> that mockeſt and laugheſt at mee when by miſaduenture I fell to the earth like a lubber: but if I could catch thee: Is this euill done to laugh without dooing other harme (quoth the ſpright) thou threatneſt mee vainelie and with iniurie, for hauing done thée a good turne, for if I would, it is not yet one houre paſſed, but that I might haue let thee falne from aboue the clouds vppon the hard rocks: where contrariwiſe, I haue let thee fall downe eaſily vppon the graſſe and ſoft ground, for not hurting thee. And if I haue a little plaide the Frog with thee, to laugh at the fire of thy pleaſant youth, it hath not béene for thine euill, but for thy good. For I am thy Kinſman, and I loue thee, and take delight to helpe thee, as hereafter thou ſhalt vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, at ſuch time as thou ſhalt haue neede of mee. And knowe that it was I which chaſed thy horſe to the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, to make him ſteale from vnder thee, and to make thee fall with the ſhielde. For which the poore innocent beaſt is now well puniſhed, for the ſauage beaſts of mount <hi>Caucas</hi> are deſcended in great nomber at the ſent of his freſh fleſh, and haue deuoured and eaten him: as likewiſe they would haue done thee, (being not able to ſaue thy ſelfe with all thy force and hardines) if I had not tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thee from that place, where I haue dwelt two yeares and more, conuerſing about the tree and Trophie, alwaies in watch to hearken and attend thy comming, and to ſaue thee my ſhielde, which belonged to none but thee. And all thoſe that haue aſſayed to take it before thy comming, I haue caſt them downe headlong, and ruinated them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diuers waies, and after another order then thou art falne: in ſomuch that they returned no more to take it downe. For I kept it for thee, and I giue it thee, carrie it with thee, and keepe it well, ſo it ſhall ſtand thée in great ſtead many times. Now is my wrath and guard atchiued, I wil returne to my repoſe, where I ſhal alwaies be readie to ayde thée in thy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame neceſſities. Salute in my behalfe thy father <hi>Franc-Gal</hi> whom through my meanes thou ſhalt fee this day; for
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:176416:73"/>if I had not this night brought thee more then 1200. miles, thou hadſt neuer ſeen him, reccon vnto him the things which thou haſt ſeene, and ſhowe him this ſhield. Tell him that <hi>Gallehault Macrobe</hi> whom he knoweth, ſendeth him word, that very ſhortly hee will viſit him, to reuenge the mortall wound which he receiued of him: to God I commend thee. And thus as <hi>Alector</hi> would haue thanked him, and deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded an interpretation of his ſayings, he ſawe him ſoddainely changed into a long and cleere flame of fire like a tayled com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, flying through the ayre more ſwifter than the ſhot of a Croſſe bowe, mounting ſtill towards the higher Region through the which hee had béene brought, and followed him ſtill with the eye vntill he had loſt the ſight thereof. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon knowing not what other thing to doo, hee laid him downe with his ſhield vpon the graſſe, and remembring in himſelf the calke which he had had with <hi>Gallehault</hi> the great black Knight with the clouen head, hee fell a ſleepe in the freſh of the morning, a little before the breake of the day, at ſuch time as all liuing creatures take ſleepe, by reaſon of the moyſtnes of the night falling.</p>

<hi>Augure</hi> which was happened to me the day before: for as I was at a windowe in the pallace of <hi>Tangut</hi> where I was lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, there came flying towards me a young Doue carrying in her bill a branch of bay
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:176416:73"/>leaues which ſhe preſented to my hands and reſted vpon my ſiſt: and as I did contemplate and behold how iollie ſhe was decked with feathers violet, changeable, and guilded round about her neck like an enameled chaine, I ſaw comming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me two great birds of pray: the one a Rauen croking, who reſted vpon my head, the other a red Vultur who raui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed away the Doue with his clawes very far off, and high, inſomuch that I loſt the ſight thereof, and auon after he came flying by mee againe carrying alwaies the Doue with him, which me thought was become a ſtorke, carrying in her bill a turning and wreathing ſerpent.

This <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> (which of a trueth was very ſiniſter and of an euil preſage to me) did ſo trouble mee, and repreſented vnto mee ſo many curſed ſignifications, that I could not ſléepe in all the night: wherefore being wearie of my vnquietnes, I aroſe before day, &amp; hauing deliberated to depart very ſhortly, I went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Sea to ſee how my <hi>Hippopotame</hi> fared: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon it happened that in paſſing through the meddow (being yet ſomewhat dark) I perceiued a far off a certaine long light ſtretched out nere the ground, yelding ſuch a brightnes that one might well ſée that there was one laid thereby, and ſtill me thought I had ſéene this light before that time. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore approching more nere, and <hi>Aurora</hi> already hauing cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed away the darkenes of the night, I ſaw a moſt fayre yong man ſléeping ful ſwéetly: at the firſt ſight of whom, mine en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trailes moued within me, and I might perceiue that he was laid vpon the gréene ſhield of braſſe with the Cock of golde, which partely I knewe to bee that which I had before time hanged vpon the Trophie, meruailing much how he ſhould<pb n="138" facs="tcp:176416:74"/>come by it. For after I had hong it vpon the trée, and ſéeing it ſo fayre, I had great deſire my ſelfe to haue carried it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and did my endeuor to haue plucked it downe againe, but it was in vaine: for I might aſwell haue plucked vp the trée by the roote, but a grey Crowe iugging ouer mée, cryed:
<q>
                  <l>Labor no more to gaine the ſhield,</l>
                  <l>For t'is ordained for a twiſe borne Child.</l>
               </q>Which when I vnderſtood I left off, eſtéeming that it ſhould neuer happen to any; for as a man dieth but once, ſo is hée borne but once. And thereupon I remembred my ſelfe of the double birth of <hi>Alector</hi> which the meſſenger had accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to mée, and therefore I imagined that the fayre Eſquire might bee my Sonne <hi>Alector:</hi> conſidering alſo the ſworde which hee wore, which incontinently I knew to bée the ſame that I had ſent him with the ſhining ſcabberd, which was that which I ſaw firſt gliſter, beholding likewiſe his rich apparrell, and the chaine of gold about his neck, which were tokens of nobleneſſe. Beſides this I ſaw the ſtreaks of his face reſembling the forme and beautie of the Quéene <hi>Priſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raxe,</hi> yea more fayre and more admirable, and remembring with my ſelfe moreouer, of the fodaine and great growth, that I was informed of his aduanced youth. All which things conferred together, I aſſured my ſelfe for certaine, that this young Eſquire was my Sonne <hi>Alector,</hi> which made my heart to throb and mine ryes to ſhed teares through pittie and Fatherly loue. And thus as I beheld him through amorous affection, hée began to ſtretch out his armes and to open his eyes ſo cléere as fine criſtall, and ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me before him, ſodainely hee aroſe on his féete, and after an honeſt reuerence hee began his ſpeech with the firſt word of trueth ſaying to me thus: good Father what would you, that thus peaceably haue ouertaken me ſléeping, and thus atteutiuely beholden mee. Fayre Sonne (quoth I) for that me thinks I ſhould knowe thée, and yet haue I neuer ſéene thée before this preſent houre for the which I render thanks to the Soueraigne. And the firſt word which thou haſt vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:176416:74"/>in reuerence of mine age (as I thinke) in calling me by the name of Father, is iſſued out of thy mouth by naturall inſtinction, for I am thy Father, and thou my Sonne borne of the Quéene
<hi>Priſcaraxe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You are then <hi>Franc-Gal</hi> (quoth <hi>Alector</hi>) the great olde Knight with the ſwimming and flying horſe? For other Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will I not acknowledge vnder the Heauens: <hi>Franc-Gal</hi> am I for certaine (quoth I) and to put thée in more aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance come with me, and I will ſhow thee my ſwimming and flying horſe. To this hée moſt willingly agreed, ſo went wée deuifing together vnto the ſea ſide, where I ſhowed him my great horſe <hi>Durat Hippopotame,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which he ſéeing ſo great, ſo puiſſant and merueilous, that a hundred terreſtriall horſes were not comparable vnto him, hee was aſtoniſhed, deſiring greatly to be mounted vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, in lamenting his own which the ſauage beaſts had eaten. Then knowing for certain that I was his Father
<hi>Franc-Gal,</hi> hee proſtrated himſelfe on his knées in humble reuerence before me, acknowledging me and ſaying: my Lord and my Father, behold here your humble Sonne <hi>Alector</hi> which my Lady &amp; Mother the Quéene <hi>Priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caraxe,</hi> hath ſent your O how truly hath
<hi>Gallehault</hi> the great black knight ſpoken and kept promiſe, who told me that this day hee would ſet mee in ſuch a place where I ſhould ſée my Lord and Father <hi>Franc-Gal:</hi> without the aide of which good ſpirit, it had béene impoſſible for mee euer to haue found you through ſo many long and diuers errors. Hereupon I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of him, who was that <hi>Gallehault</hi> Knight, and that good ſpirit who had adreſſed him to me? and in our returning and going towards <hi>Tangut</hi> hee accounted to mée all his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueutures, and the conqueſt of the faire ſhield in ſuch ſort as I haue recited it: whereby I vnderſtood that it was the great and valiant Knight, the théefe which I has ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne and ſlaine againſt my will through his owne ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate courage, and buried at the foote of the Trophie, and then I knew that the ſhield was deſtinated to <hi>Alector,</hi> but that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> black Knight threatned to ſée me ſhortly, yea and to reuenge his death; that gaue mee a ſad ſignification,<pb n="140" facs="tcp:176416:75"/>with the euill auguries which I had the day before. But the great ioy I had to ſee my Sonne
<hi>Alector</hi> ſo fayre, ſo well borne, brought vp, and taught, and of ſo happie a beginning, made mee forget all ill coniectures, and to ſet a ſide all doubts and feares of infortunes which hong before mine eyes, and which as yet are not ended. And ſo deuiſing, we returned to the palace where my men attended me, vnknowing but that I was yet in bed, becauſe in the morning at my departure, I had firmed my chamber doore, and was iſſued without the knowledge of any one, for euery man ſlept ſoundly. Being thus returned to the Pallace, after I had declared to my men who and what
<hi>Alector</hi> was, all of them receiued him with great ioy, with admiration of his beautie and good grace, doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him moſt great honor and reuerence, yea more than to my ſelfe (as many doo rather worſhip the Sunne riſing, than going down) for the which I was neither ſorie nor enuions; for his great beautie, vertue and honeſtie, did well merit it: hereupon the tables were couered, and wee went to dinner moſt gorgiouſly. And amongſt other communications which were held at the table, <hi>Alector</hi> declared to me the great grief that <hi>Priſcaraxe</hi> had of my long tarrying, and of the earneſt deſire which ſhee had of my returne, for the accompliſhing whereof ſhe moſt affectuouſly required me by him, which he alſo on his part moſt earneſtly deſired, ſaying that hee had promiſed and ſworne to the Quéene his Mother, neuer to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne againe to her, vnles he brought me with him: beſéech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me with humble reuerence to doo him the fauor to ſatiſfie his promiſes. Wherefore, I who was no leſſe affectionated towards the Mother and Sonne, than they towards me, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberated, and made him promiſe aſſuredly to depart the next day: and for that cauſe I commanded my men to truſſe vp harneſſe and baggage, to appoint and make readie my good horſe <hi>Durat:</hi> which they did with great and good diligence. The whiles I and <hi>Alector</hi> went to take leaue of the King of <hi>Tangut,</hi> rendering him thanks for his hoſpitalitie: who on the contrarie, thanked vs of the good ſuccor which I and my people had done him with our great <hi>Hippopotame</hi> againſt a<pb n="141" facs="tcp:176416:75"/>horrible monſter of the Sea called <hi>Trolual,</hi> ſo great as a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Iſle in the Sea, or a great mountaine on the earth: who, at euerie ful moone would caſt himſelf into the hauens, ports and créekes, deuouring and deſtroying all that he met, and ſwallowing vp men women and children aliue, yea horſes, kine, and other beaſts. This monſter
<hi>Trolual</hi> ſéeing our great <hi>Hippopotame</hi> going vpon the Sea, and we mounted vppon him, thruſting and breaking the waues before him, lanched himſelf with terrible impetuoſitie againſt vs and our great horſe, where he thought to haue had aboundant pray: but he found <hi>mauchat maurat,</hi> or <hi>maurat mauchat:</hi>
               <note place="margin">A Prouerbe in France when one meeteth with his match.</note> for our <hi>Hippopotame</hi> (who is the moſt hurtfull creature and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt dooer of harme in all the world, when he is puiſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to with violence) as the <hi>Trolual</hi> opened his mouth ſo large as the arch of a gate to haue ſwallowed him vp and vs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with: hee caught him with his two great teeth before by the lip, in rayſing him out of the water ſo high as we were, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by preſently I thruſt my launce into his throate, with the poynt ſticking &amp; faſtning in his roofe, and the great end plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in his iawe belowe; ſo as the monſter found himſelfe faſt in the téeth of mine

            <p>This ſelfe ſame euening <hi>Alector</hi> ſtirred vp with a moſt ardent deſire and impatience of longer tarrying, with moſt earneſt expoſtulation, humbly prayed me for the firſt requeſt of the Son to his Father, that if I loued him, at the ſelfe ſame houre I ſhould make him Knight, which I as one that could not refuſe to do any thing for him, eaſily yelded to his requeſt, for the accompliſhment whereof, going about to ſpeake the ſolemne words and to lift vp mine arme to giue him the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colade, all humaiue puiſſance failed me, as though I had had the paiſie, of tongue, arme, and all the parts of my bodie: and when Aleft off, my puiſſance and force came againe to mee, and as I would haue proued to reiterate the ſame twiſe or thriſe, ſo often this paiſey came vpon me; whereby I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectured that either the time ſerued not thereunto, or ets that I was not he ordained of the heauens that ſhould giue <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector</hi> the order of Knighthood.

               <hi>Orbe,</hi> I haue found thée (O <hi>Archier</hi>) in a good houre, who haſt ſolaced mee with thy good and pleaſant talke, and with thy ſweete patience in hearing my ſad and diſcomfortable diſcourſes: but a ſorrowfull and paſſionated heart, findeth it ſelfe verie much alledged, if it may get ſome <hi>Sympathic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thi</hi> perſon to whome it may declare his dolors, as I haue done to thée (O good old man) who haſt patiently giuen eare to the rehearſall of my diuers and finiſter aduentures, with compaſſion and condoliance, as thy teares themſelues doo witnes: (and thereupon the <hi>Archier,</hi> wept pittifullie) and in this patience and communication of thy good talke and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie, (for the which I thank thée) thou haſt conducted mee hether to this place, which as I think is the towne of <hi>Orbe:</hi> (and at that inſtant they entred into the gate of <hi>Orbe.</hi>)</p>
            <p>It is truely the Citie of <hi>Orbe</hi> (quoth the <hi>Archier</hi>) where is the faire <hi>Theatre,</hi> and the magnifical temple of God
<hi>Ioue,</hi> wherof (for not diſſembling with thée) I am the Arch-prieſt and great ſacrificer, hauing neere to the temple a moſt ample and fayre lodging where I dwell ordinarily, well garniſhed (thanks be to GOD) with all things neceſſarie to the life of man: where I beſéech thée in honour of <hi>Ioue Xenios</hi> to take thy lodging and right of hoſpitalitie with mée, for the night draweth on, and it is time to drawe towards reſt, where wee may after at our eaſe atchieue the reſidue of our talke. This offer preſented by the good old <hi>Archier</hi> with his entier heart. <hi>Franc-Gal</hi> refuſed not, but willingly accepted of it, thanking him for his gentle hoſpitalitie, and went with him: his Squire
<hi>Oplophor</hi> following him, who of ſuch and ſo long ſermons willingly fed not himſelf, thinking it long that they were not already houſed. So entred they into the towne at the eaſt gate called port
<hi>Phyſe</hi> (for the Citie of <hi>Orbe</hi> was great and excellent fayre, ſuch as hereafter ſhall be deſcribed) ſo went they forwards through a great, long, large, and ſtreight ſtréet (where euery one in paſſing by did reuerence to the <hi>Archier</hi>) vntill they came into a moſt large place where the foure great ſtréets of the foure principall gates met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and in the mids of the place was the great
<hi>Dome</hi> or<pb n="146" facs="tcp:176416:78"/>temple builded round, the fayreſt and moſt magniſteal which poſſibly was to be ſéene, and ſo high, that the top thereof ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to excéede the clouds. At the inſtance of the <hi>Archier</hi> they entred therein, &amp; before the altar which was in the mids they knéeled downe with adoration and thanks giuing, lifting vp their eyes and looking vp towards heauen through a rounde lanterne which was right ouer the altar in the top and midſt of the pinacle, where infinit lampes were hanging burning and ſhining night and day, which ſet foorth the place moſt worſhipfull and princelike. Their prayers done they aroſe, and by a little dore in the temple whereof the <hi>Archier</hi> had the key, they entred into a fayre houſe which was the <hi>Archiers</hi> dwelling, very ſumptuous and magnificall, where they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into a fayre and great hall hong with rich tapiſtrie, with large and high windowes glaſſed with imagerie, and houing proſpect into fayre gardens and orchards. In which hall briefely the tables were couered, and water brought in, and they two fitting downe alone, were ſerued with delicate and exquiſit meates.
<hi>Franc-Gal</hi> ſéeing none ſet but them twaine, aſked where the Miſtreſſe of the houſe was? The miſtreſſe of the houſe (quoth the <hi>Archier</hi>) is none other then <hi>Reaſon</hi> and
<hi>Sapience,</hi> ſent by the Soueraigne, by whome all this houſe is ruled and gouerned: for being from my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuitie vowed to ſacred things (which ought purely to bee handled) neither my body nor heart conſenting, haue euer been polluted with woman, nor other fleſhelie attouchings, nor ſhall not be I hope. For hauing by diuine grace kept the virginicall puritie wherein I was borne, vntill this preſent age, which is foure hundred and fiftéene yeares, till white ſnowes and colde froſts which lye on the tops of the mountaines, ſufficiently declare that there ſhall not bée much more heate belowe in the valleys. And for ſo much as by reuelation made in the aſſembly of the people, I was conſtituted <hi>Archier,</hi> that is to ſay Prince or chiefe of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creds, and not an Archer ſhooter, although for the auoyding of idlenes the Mother of all vices, commonly I exerciſe my ſelfe to ſhoote in a Bowe at the beaſts and birds eſtranged

And ſo I was and am yet Arch-prieſt and principall ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer of the temple of <hi>Ioue.</hi> By whoſe reuelation and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition. I knew of thy comming into this countrey be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſaw thee, and to encounter and receiue thée I was ſent by him to the place where thou didſt ſtude mée: the reſt, I will communicate vnto thée to morrowe: for now the houre of nightly prayer calleth me to mine office, get thée to reſt in peace. This ſpoken the <hi>Archier</hi> went to the temple, wherein he entred all alone, about the firſt Vigile of the night making faſt the doore after him. On the other ſide two Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters with two candleſticks of ſiluer and two cierges of pure and ſwéete waxe conducted <hi>Franc-Gal</hi> into a faire cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber al wanſcotted with Cypres, and ſaid him in a bed of Ebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie garniſhed with clothes of red veluer with fringes of ſat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, the curtaines of taffatie changeable white and black, and the teaſterne of gréene and broune, ſowed with teares of ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. At all which things <hi>Franc-Gal</hi> (who was one of the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt men in all the nine ages) tooke great héed, with obſeruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the euill preſage which all theſe things ſhewed in ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of his death nere at hand for he knew vs well that the Cypres was a funerall &amp; ſepulchear trée, and that the cerges belonged to buriall that the Ebonie was a good ſinking to the bottome of the waters: the red fringed with ſky colour, to be the vermillion life turning into leadie and mortall heaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: and the changeable curtaines of white and black to be a ſigne of change from light to darkenes, &amp; from life to death. Wherefore
<hi>Franc-Gal</hi> who was of ſingular and almoſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine wiſdome, remembring his oracles, viſions, threatnings ſent him by the ſpirit of the black Knight, the <hi>Augurie</hi> of the Rauen, &amp; rauiſhment of his Son <hi>Alector,</hi> knew by foreſight that his death was ordained, and which hee concluded to bee neere at hand without any feare or ſorrowe, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing onely that he had not ſéene his welbeloued
<hi>Priſcaraxe</hi> and his deere Sonne <hi>Alector</hi> once before his death. For the humaine condition of mortall men is ſuch, that
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:176416:79"/>neuer man (how infortunate ſoeuer hee bee) dieth without ſorrowe of ſome thing left imperfect. Notwithſtanding <hi>Franc-Gal</hi> after many and diuers thoughts tormenting his heart, finally concluded to that which was neceſſarie, and humbly to ſubmit himſelfe to the diuine immouable ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: and with this reſolution after long waking he fell into a doubtfull ſleepe about the ſecond crowe of the Cock, a little before the breake of day at ſuch time as the moiſture of the night falling either into dew or hoarie froſt, bringeth drou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie ſleepe vpon all creatures.</p>

<hi>Franc-Gal</hi> went on one ſide of the altar knéeling downe to prayer, and the <hi>Archier</hi> remained before the altar proſtrate in long and ſilent prayer with the heart and not with the mouth.

<hi>Shalbe,</hi> a name which is aboue all names, and which appertaineth to none other but him: firſt hath made you of nothing, which is an eſpeciall gift of his marueilous puiſſance, that you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all other things know that of him you hold your being and firſt eſſence. And after that he hath created you, not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble bodies, as ſtones and mettals; not inſenſible plants, as hearbes or trees; not brutal, deformed, cruel or monſterous beaſts; as if it had pleaſed him, he might haue formed you but Aſſes, ill ſhapen pottage pots, villanous Todes, cruell raui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing wolues, or monſterous imaginations: but he hath crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted you men, fayre &amp; right, loking vp to heauen, whereby you hold the roote of reaſon which he hath giuen you: by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you are made like to himſelf, &amp; by him formed to his own image. Beſides this, he hath made al other creatures, the elements, yea the celeſtiall bodies themſelues, and heauens for you, and for your vſe and ſeruice: the earth, to ſuſtaine &amp; nouriſh you quick, and receiue you when you be dead: the ayre, to keepe your ſoule in life: the waters, for your vſage, cleanſing, and nauigation: the fire, to reuiue your heate, and for your light: the Starres, for tokens and influences: and the heauens, to receiue your ſoules which hee hath giuen you immortall, through ſpirituall priueledge aboue all other creatures, who<pb n="153" facs="tcp:176416:81"/>being once dead, nothing remaine more of them. All beaſts he hath condemned with their heads enclining towards the earth, in ſigne that they be ſubiect and ſeruiceable to you who are directly eleuated: ſome for your help, as horſes, oxen, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and cammels, yea the great and ſtrong Elephant dooth ſerue and obay you: the others for meate and nouriſhment, who by their deathes conſerue your liues.

He deſireth no other thing of you (my friends) but a very ſmall retribution and acknowledge, neuertheles he will that it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede from you and from your hearts. Hee will nothing of you for ſo many and infinite benefits, but onely a ſimple and <pb n="154" facs="tcp:176416:82"/>little gramertie, one onely thanks giuing and one collauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and glorification to the benefactor: the which we would gladly doo to any mortall man, for any ſmall pleaſure that he ſhould haue done vs. But hée will that this recogniſance, this thanks giuing and retribution of glorie bée giuen him of your owne proper, pure, and beſt of the heart, without fayning or diſſimulation, which cannot be hidden from him. For without compariſon hee ſéeth more cléerelie into our thoughts than wee doo ſee into theſe exterior things, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our corporall ſenſes may be deceiued, but hee not, becauſe hee is a moſt pure and ſimple Spirite. Wherefore (my friends) in humble and hartie thankes giuing for ſo many benefits which hée hath alreadie beſt owed vpon vs, which he daily dooth, and promiſeth to doo in time to come: chiefely for that hee hath this day reuealed by mee that this Citie and common wealth ſhall bee preſently deliuered of a great euill wherewith it is troubled: for theſe infinit of benefits let vs render vnto him all together with one heart and true zeale, with one faith thought, and will, and with one ſpeach and voyce, thanks, honour, glorie, and praiſe for euer and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer world without end."</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He firſt night that <hi>Franc-Gal</hi> was receiued into the houſe of the <hi>Archier,</hi> after they had ſupped, and talked, and that he was conducted into his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting chamber, which ſeemed ſo meſt full vnto him,<pb n="157" facs="tcp:176416:83"/>as hath béen ſhowne: the
<hi>Archier</hi> according to his cuſtome went to the temple to his euening prayers, where as he was praying, generally for all, but eſpecially for his gueſt <hi>Franc-Gal</hi> that he might heare good newes of that which he ſought for: it ſéemed to him of a ſudaine to heare the deadly hiſſing of an Adder, and the intempeſtiue crowe of a Cock, for as yet it was not the ſecond Vigile of the night. And hereuppon through the lanterne in the top of the the temple, hee might perceiue a light, reſembling a moſt clere Starre to fall vpon the Altar, which no ſooner had toucht the table of emerauld, but it kindled and aroſe in a high and right flame, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe mounted decreaſing: and incontinently after this Starre followed a Swan as white as ſnowe, who reſted her ſelfe hard by this celeſtiall fire, and with the ſweete blaſt of <hi>Zephyrus</hi> began her deadly ſong, which ſhee is accuſtomed by nature to ſing vpon the banks of the crooked riuer of <hi>Mc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> when ſhee is repoſed vpon the wet graſſe, and percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth her death at hand: and in ſinging diſtilled from her eyes aboundance of teares which fell vpon the Starrie fire, and quenched it by little and little: the ſwanne likewiſe afféebling both in voyce and life, according as the fire deminiſhed: in ſuch ſort that at the laſt teare which the ſwanne ſhed, ſhe died, and the fire vaniſhed flaming vp into heauen from whence it was deſcended. By this viſion, the <hi>Archier</hi> incontinently vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that the latter end of <hi>Franc-Gal</hi> was nere at hand, and that hee ſhould ſhortly dye through ſome dolorous or ioyfull cauſe. Wherefore in the morning before his entrie into the Temple, hee went to viſit him, but hee found him not in his chamber; whereon looking out at the windowe he perceiued him walking in the garden very penſiue, whereinto he went and ſaluted him: <hi>Franc-Gal</hi> ſaluted him againe in a voyce very low and hidden. Then the <hi>Archier</hi> aſked him where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was riſen before day, and had not taken his reſt at his eaſe? My reſt (quoth <hi>Franc-Gal</hi>) is very nere, ſo far as I vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand by many preſages, but chiefely this night through the phantaſie of mine vnquietnes, which haue not ſuffered me to repoſe: to the end they might prepare a durable ſléepe<pb n="158" facs="tcp:176416:84"/>for mee, without waking vntill the reuolution of the world. And therefore let vs goe to the Temple to pray and giue thanks to him, who hath permitted our being till this preſent: ſo went theſe two good wiſe men right to the temple to accompliſh the ſacrifice, ſuch as hath alreadie been reeſted. Which being done the greateſt part of the people aſſembled the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues at the great <hi>Baſilique Dicaſte,</hi> where <hi>Diocles</hi> bore rule as Potentate of <hi>Orbe,</hi> with all the Benchers, Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, Lords, and notable Citizens.

This young Squire com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming before the face of the magiſtrates, of the whole iuſtice, and of the Potentate, ſhewed himſelfe ſo aſſured and braue, as they ſéemed to bee ſeuere and graue, demanding at that inſtant Iuſtice againſt the murthering Archer of his fayre and welbeloued

            <p>The Potentate and all the Magiſtrates were amerueiled, not onely at the braue hardines of <hi>Alector</hi> (which naturally might come of the fire of his age) but much more of his libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall eloquence and reaſonable wiſdome before age, albeit he were farre yonger than they tooke him to bee.

Then cried he with a loude voyce to all the aſſiſtance, if there were any that would challenge it againſt him? But no man anſwered word. Wherefore hee faſtned it vnder his girdle, and ſayd: Now my Lords let vs go when it pleaſeth you, ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I haue mine armes, I am ready to fight againſt this dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon and publique enemie, and to reuenge the priuat iniurie<pb n="161" facs="tcp:176416:85"/>of murther if the traytor may be found.

            <p>At this crie all the Citizens prepared themſelues to go ſée this dilectable and profitable ſpectacle: where were founde a greater number of people than euer were at the ſands for out aſſemblie.

In the ſame was a long, large and ample hall whoſe mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was of marble ſtayres, and whoſe entrance was by two gates on either ſide. This great hall was lofted and paued with ſutable artifice all of white and black marble: the loft being duble was ſuſtained by 40. pillers of grey ſtone,
<hi>viz.</hi> 12. on either ſide &amp; 12. in the mids parting the two lofts, and two in the vpper end of the hall and two below.

Betwéene the pillers on either curtaine of the wall, on the higheſt towards the arch of the loft were fayre glaſſe windowes, decorated, painted &amp; il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrated with ancient Hiſtories, memorable examples, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and ſingular ſentences and executions of Iuſtice: and beneath were fixed great braſen tables wherein with groſſe letters legible a far off, were engraued, all their lawes: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which (being once receaued in the common wealth of <hi>Orbe</hi>) the Citizens gouerned themſelues. And for this reaſon were theſe lawes engraued in tables of braſſe that none might pretend ignorance of the lawes: at one ende of the foreſaide hall was a Parquet or place of audience cloſed with yron barres wrought and ſiluered, with two rowes of ſeats with their deſks and footeſtooles: the one on high where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in were placed the Orators and aduocats and the other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe wherein the pledors ſat, the complainants on the one ſide and the defendants on the other. Aboue and ouer againſt the end of this Parquet was eleuated a high Tribunall, all made of Ebonie wrought and réeled verie artificially, on both ſides of which Tribunal were 24. ſeats ſomewhat lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,<pb n="166" facs="tcp:176416:88"/>that is to ſay: 12. on the right hand and 12. on the left: whereon the 24. <hi>Aſſeſors</hi> and principall counſellors ſat in cloth of veluet; and in the Tribunall, ſat the Potentate and chiefe Iuſtice: which Tribunall in ſtead of crimſon veluet or cloth of gold, was hong and couered with the hideous ſkin of a dead man, which was ſometime a Potentate and wicked Iudge, and who for his tranuerſing of iuſtice and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſing of his Soueraigne office had béene flean quick, and his ſkinne in ſtead of tapiſterie put vpon the Iuſtice ſeate to giue example to thoſe who afterwards ſhould ſit therein, not to doo any iniuſtice worthie of ſo ſharpe a puniſhment. On the two ſides of the foreſaide Tribunall was placed reaſonable high, two ſtatues, the one of golde which was the image of Iuſtice cut and ſigured with a virginicall vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, neuertheleſſe of a vehement and redoubtable regarde, the light of her eyes ſharpe and pricking, neither humble nor fierce, but repreſenting a certame dignitie of reuerend ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: this ſtatue was of Golde to ſignifie that as the Gold is incorruptible, ſo Iuſtice ought to bee: and as it is ſoft and plyable, ſo ought Iuſtice to be more ſoft and mercifull than rigorous and more bending to equitie. The ſtatue was fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured a Virgin, becauſe that Iuſtice ought to be entier, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violated and vncorrupted, ſhe was of face ſeuere ſad and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, in ſigne that Iuſtice ought not to giue care to ſwéete words, prayers, flatteries nor praiſes: her regarde was fierce and vehement, to giue terror to the euill, and confidence and aſſurance to the iuſt and good. On the other ſide was a ſtatue of fine Criſtall clere and white, portracted all naked, which was the ſtatue of <hi>Veritie:</hi> in ſigne that Iuſtice is or ought to bee accompanied with <hi>Veritie,</hi> who of her ſelfeis clere and cuident, pure and without ſpot, and for that cauſe ſhe was portraicted of white and moſt gliſtering Chriſtall, and in forme of an naked body, for <hi>Veritie</hi> will haue no co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering of fraude or diſſimulation but ſheweth her ſelfe as ſhe is. Thus you may perceiue what their great hall of this <hi>Baſilicq Dicaſte</hi> with the
<hi>Parquit</hi> and iudicial ſeate were: adioyning to the vpper ende whereof on the right and left<pb n="167" facs="tcp:176416:88"/>hand were two bodies of a houſe, membred with many chambers, and amongſt the reſt in either houſe was a right fayre chamber in faſhion of a foure ſquared hall, garniſhed round about with ſettles belowe, and with rich capiſtrie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue: For the reſt cleane emptie of other things ſauing with tables and chayres about them: and both theſe chambers had entrance into the <hi>Parquit</hi> of the great
<hi>Balican</hi> hall, the chamber on the right hand being called the counſell chamber: becauſe thether the Potentate and <hi>Aſſeſors</hi> retired them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues when any doubtfull iudgement was remitted to the counſaile. In the mids thereof, was a large table of marble round and
<hi>Polygonal.</hi> For this table held 25. entrangulared ſpaces, euerie one of a foote and a halfe broade, and about the ſame ſo many chaires made brauely of common wood. But one amongſt the reſt being more large was made of Cedar, wrought and guided with fayre figures, with a footeſtoole that hee which ſet vpon it might ſit ſomewhat higher than the reſt, and a cloth of eſtate and a pillowe of veluet where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on the Potentate and Preſident did ſit in the mids of this Marble table, was a little piller of Chriſtall, and on the ſame a ſtatue of like matter <hi>Diaphane</hi> which repreſented the Image of <hi>Prudence</hi> in a feminine forme, not naked but co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered with a long Criſtallin ſtole, embrodered with damaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quines of Gold, and ſéemed with Golden Starres. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe ſhee had three heads that ſhee might bee better brayned and more ſage, the one was olde regarning the things paſt, another of meane age conſidering things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and the third young, foreſeeing things to come. In her right hand ſhee hild a Lydian ſtone which ſome call a touch ſtone, and with her left hand ſhee preſented a little table of Golde wheren weere written theſe words in Greeke.

            <p>In this chamber was the counſaile held, and for that cauſe called the counſaile chamber; the other chamber on the left hand was called the chamber <hi>Sphragide,</hi> becauſe that in it was ſigned and ſealed all acts, inſtruments and exploites of Iuſtice, written by faithfull perſonages thereunto deputed, and by ſolemne oath ſworne: this chamber was like the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, ſauing that it had two long tables of the length of the hall alongſt the wall, with glaſſe windowes aboue, and long benches beneath with ſeats ſeperated and diſtinct by little ſpaces like to the ſeats of the quire in acanonicall Church, and therein were ſet the Pragmaticall writers in two ranks on the one ſide and the other of the two walls, neuertheleſſe but onely on one ſide of the tables which was in the hench ſide next to the walls: the other ſide of the tables being em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty ſauing that they had two mounting ſteps, whereby thoſe who had there to doo might the eaſier come to the two tables.

Whereinto was no entrance but through a little wicket with two dores of yron, barred and boulted comming out of the great hall: and theſe two towers were with thrée roomes, the one in the ground very déep, without window or light, &amp; that was called the <hi>Barathre:</hi> the middle out of the ground, receiuing a little ſhimmering light through the hoales before named, and this was called <hi>Latumie:</hi> the third was aboue, hauing barred windowe and lettices, whereby thoſe who were put therein might both ſée and bée ſéene, and for that cauſe it was called the Cage. Within theſe two towers were locked all malefactors either in the déepeſt middlemoſt or higheſt, according to the waight of their offences: beneath the great <hi>Baſilican</hi> hall was a vault cloſed with ſtrong wals on all ſides, ſauing it had a ſmall doore with bares of yron, and a windowe grated with yron to giu light, within which vault (which was called <hi>Criptoportique,</hi> and no leſſe wider nor larger than the great hall, and for cauſe builded with many ſmall chambers) were put the ciuill priſoners or cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues, vnder the charge of a keeper béeing a ſufficient honeſt man: as on the contrarie, for keeping the Towers, two rude and barbarous gaolers were appoynted. And alſo the keeping of the two Chambers both Councell and Sphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gide was committed to two Conſiergs men right auncient and wiſe, both for the cuſtodie of them, and apparrelling of
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:176416:90"/>the hall and Parquet when neceſſitie required. And at the two gates of the great hall were ordained two porters to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen and ſhut them at ſunne riſing and going downe, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Equinoctiall time. Such was the <hi>Baſilican Dicaſt</hi> of the iuſtice of <hi>Orbe,</hi> wherein <hi>Diocles</hi> the Potentate ſat as preſident, right ouer againſt the which was the <hi>Hippodro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me</hi> a great egall and vniformed place being in length 187. paces and a halfe, and in breadth 62. paces and a halfe, in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion ſoure ſquared, not equilaterall but farre more longer than large, all enuironed with triple galleries erected one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue another with arches ſuſteyned with little carued pillers; and this was the place, where men on horſeback ran for the beſt game for the ring, and there was the place of Iuſtice and triall of armes on horſeback with lance, ſword, hatchet, and club. At one of the ends of the <hi>Hippodrome</hi> was the barr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers wherein the horſes were encloſed, beating the ground with their feete, and forcibly ſtaying till the ſigne of running were giuen by the trumpetors at the commandement of the Iudges: at the other end was a ſcaffold of marble ſtone flue degrées of height and feats thereon for the ſayreſt damoſels of the towne to ſit, aſſigned thereunto by ordinarie exthange to giue and deliuer the prize of honour and valour to the beſt doers, according to the ſentence of the Iudges who had their places in a lower porch in the mids of the <hi>Hippodrome,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene the rancks of the galleries: and on the other ſide right ouer againſt them were mounted the trumpets, who at the commandement of the Iudges ſounded to giue ſigne. And ſo ſoone as the barriers were open, the gallant light horſe iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued out to the courſe, and the Knights to the lifts to iuſt: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie one aſſaying to carrie away the prize and honor, being no les pricked forward by the ſharp regard of the fayre may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, then their horſes were moued with the ſound of trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets and prick of the ſpurs: and thus you may perceiue what the <hi>Hippodrome</hi> was. The third building was the <hi>Prytan</hi> or publique houſe of the citie: in theforefrunt whereof was a large lower court, and from thence one mounted by 10. ſtayres of ſton into a right great and large hall garniſhed all<pb n="171" facs="tcp:176416:90"/>along the walls with benches, and at either end a great chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney aboue the benches, the walls were couered with bookes and raſtles, whereon were hanged al ſorts of armes, ſwords, lances, corſelets, morraines, and other harnis in abundance. In this hal the people aſſembled in the laſt wéeke of Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to change the magiſtrates of the yere before, and to chuſe new for the yeares following, and to take aduiſe what was to be done for the vtilitie of the common wealth. Ouer and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide this great hall there was a walking place ſquared, and cléere on all ſides with many windowes. Through this was a way into another leſſe hall both cloſe &amp; ſecret with a treble port, and three vſhers to guard them. Where the politick gouernours of the towne (who were 12. in number) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted and concluded the waightie affaires concerning the common wealth of <hi>Orbe.</hi> Nere to this part of the building was another great court, and in the mids thereof a fountaine with two ceſternes whoſe top being of alablaſter caſt out wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, through thrée pipes in great aboundance: beyond this court on the back ſide of this publique houſe, was another great and large part, braue, ſumpruous and magnifical, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending two great hals, the one below eleuated; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding eyght ſtayres high on the one ſide, and on the other ſide in the faſhion and forme of a ladder: the other aboue of like greatnes hauing their kitchins and offices on the one ſide, the other opening with treble windowes into the court; which two halls were garniſhed with tables of Cedar, and with ſtooles and chayres ſutable round about them, and two gréene beds of repoſe; the reſidue being hanger with rich and fayre capiſtries: wherein thoſe who dwelt there came to cate, drinke, walke and deuiſe one with another, that is to ſay, ſuch as by any good work, or profitable inuention, either by wiſdome, valour, liberalitie or other vertuous act, both ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable and profitable to the Citie had well merited of the common wealth. For whom in prize of honour and fauor, this fayre lodging was appropriated, where they were at the common expence, nouriſhed and entertained gorgiouſly with dayly banquets in the foreſaid halls, ſerued with officers<pb n="172" facs="tcp:176416:91"/>and ſeruants (at the common expence) withall, meates and diſhes, in rich veſſel of gold ſiluer and chriſtal, and with preri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous lyunen: beſides this, they were accompanied euerie day with the moſt apparant and noble Lords and Ladies of the towne, recounting vnto them often times their meritorious good déeds with praiſe and thanks. Moreouer they receiued euerie morning euery of them a fayre flower (according to the ſeaſon) with humble reuerence &amp; a ſwéet kiſſe of the moſt fayreſt maidens of the citie. And to retire themſelues priuat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apart, was ordeyned a great gallerie tranſuerſing the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid halls and parted into 24. chambers, all garniſhed a like with rich beds of imbrodery with tables &amp; treſſels wrought and furniſhed with tapiſtrie &amp; delicious linnen, euery cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber hauing adioyning vnto it a wardrop &amp; cabin, with a page proper and ready to ſerue them: the proſpect of which cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers was partly eaſterly and partly ſoutherly, into the moſt ample gardens, bowers, and medowes, where the birds con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually delighted them with their ſwéet &amp; melodious ſongs: all which was done at the expence publique of the Citizens. Beſides this euery yeare was made in the great hall below a Panegyricall oration in the honor and praiſe of the wel de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruers of the common wealth, all which things were done and maintained in the <hi>Prytan</hi> houſe, to moue and giue cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to al vertuous young men to do ſuch acts, whereby they might get ſuch fauour and meritorious praiſes as that they might be nouriſhed &amp; nobly entertained at the expence of the common wealth, in reward of their deſert &amp; good déeds which they eſtéemed a moſt great honor procéeding of iuſt cauſe, as in trueth it was: and thus you may perceiue what the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> was. Now reſteth the <hi>Theatre</hi> and the Sands whoſe proportion was in faſhion, like to an egg, conteining
2000. paces about, the wals wherof being of diuers coulored mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, were deuided in thrée ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ks of admirable arches below, in the middeſt &amp; aboue, eleuated of an incredible height, euery ranke conteyning 72. arches: among thoſe aboue, were pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſo many fayre ſtatues as there were pillers to vpholde the arches: beſide, ouer and aboue the rankes of arches, was<pb n="173" facs="tcp:176416:91"/>another ranke with 72. large and ample windowes giuing light to the halls about the <hi>Theatre</hi> whereby the people might looke in and out of the ſame: the entrance whereof was through 12. gates into the place, where for the aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vp, were eleuated 45. ſeats of ſtone, the higheſt whereof had compaſſe 1098. foote, and the twentieth ſeate after in deſcending which was the middle degrée had 726. foote in compaſſe, and the loweſt and laſt of all had 300. foote in compaſſe: whereby a man may coniecture what the other 42. ſeates did conteine in compaſſe, wherein 25000. people might ſit at their eaſe to beholde the paſtimes, euerie one of them hauing one foote and a halfe for his place, without rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning the largenes of the 12. gates. At the foote of theſe degrees was the <hi>Orcheſtre,</hi> wherein ſat the Lordes and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, and before them a little belowe was the place and platforme where for the ſolace of the common people and to win their fauor, the richeſt and notableſt Citizens oftentimes did vſe and exerciſe all manner of playes and paſtimes. In the ſame proportion right before and in the ſight of the <hi>Theatre</hi> was a great long large and ample place emptie and diſcouered: which was called the <hi>Arenes</hi> becauſe the ground was ſtrawed all ouer with ſand, to the end that both beaſtes and men might haue furer footing which came thether to the chace, to fight for the beſt game, or for the exerciſe of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, for wraſtling, running, leaping, caſting the barre, or for fighting with cudgells or ſharpe ſwords, naked or armed, or to chace and fight with all ſortes of fierce and cruell beaſtes. At the end of which place was the ſepulchre of the ancient
<hi>Archier Caliſte,</hi> before the mouth of a cloaque or gut where the great Serpent abode, againſt whome <hi>Alector</hi> the ſame day ſhould fight. Such was the <hi>Theatre</hi> and Sands of <hi>Orbe:</hi> and of ſuch magnificence was theſe foure noble build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings at the foure corners of the market place, where the foure great ſtreates met in the higheſt of the Citie: and where the moſt Emperiall Temple of <hi>Ioue</hi> was placed, the exuberant fountaine, and the fayre and holy lodging of the <hi>Archier,</hi>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:176416:92"/>and his Miniſters, together with the houſe called
<hi>Vaniah</hi> which is as much to ſay as the nouriſhment of our Lord: for therein were nouriſhed the poore, olde, ſick, lame, impotent, and fraile pedple, together with the poore Widowes and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes, with the goods offered to God in his temple. Beſides all this, there was diuerſe other publique places, as porches and walking places aſwell in raynie weather as in fayre: the foure markets, <hi>viz.</hi> the wheate market, the wine market, the fleſh market, and the fiſh market; and the fift market of fruites, eggs and white meats. Moreouer there was yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother great and large porch full of ſeats and deſks, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingled with walking places and galleries, and a high pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet of whole ſtone cut and carued, which was the place of reading and diſputation of all ſorts of artes and ſciences, and all at the publique charge of the Citie. Furthermore at the foure gates were foure fayre keys vpon the riuer ſide of <hi>Cloterre</hi> which went round about the Towne, at which keys ordinarilie ariued great boats charged with all forts of Merchandize, comming from all parts, and not onelie by riuer, but by land with Waggons, Mules. Cammells, and other horſes. For the receite and beſtowing of the which, were appointed round about the keys great ware houſes, and at euerie keye a great porch, wherein the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of all Countreys and Nations aſſembled together, and kept generall exchange of Golde Siluer and Money with writings, letters, anſweres, bills of exchange and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cariage, and all ſorts of negotiation. Thus you ſee and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the diſcription of the renowmed Citie of <hi>Orbe;</hi> which hath beene ſet downe here by way of digreſſion: after which extrauagance we muſt returne againe to our matter, which was of the combat betweene <hi>Alector</hi> and the ſerpent of the Sands.</p>

            <p>This hardie and confident ſpeach hild <hi>Franc-Gal,</hi> aboue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things; neuertheleſſe trembling like a leafe at euery aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault the ſerpent made, who was aboue thréeſcore foot in length and a yard in greatnes about, with a profound throate and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping. Who ſéeing himſelfe fruſtrate of his purpoſe, and that his inuaſions were imployed in vaine, by reaſon of the legeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie <pb n="178" facs="tcp:176416:94"/>and ſwift turning of the vigorous <hi>Alector,</hi> was chafed in his colde nature, and ſo prouoked that his throate was all ſwolne with horrible venyin, which hee had gathered together through ſpightful anger that he found reſiſtance in one onelie man. Wherefore hée wound himſelfe into a great roule, and ſoddainely by plunging out himſelfe hee would aſſayle
<hi>Alec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> who readily leaping aſide lent him great blowes ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwart the bodie: and giuing him many wounds; but not déepe enough by reaſon of the hardnes of his ſeales: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall hée raiſed the Sand. Neuertheleſſe once hée rouled vp his long tayle ſo impetuouſly wherewithall hée whipped <hi>Alector</hi> (who tooke not good heede of it) with a blow ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, that hée ſtroke him to the ground, and ſoddainely turned his head and great throat to haue deuoured him. Then <hi>Franc-Gal</hi> was out of countenance, his ſpirit was troubled, and his knées fayled him: likewiſe all the people became ſad, eſtéeming <hi>Alector</hi> for ouercome and loſt; but the couragious Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſéeing the deadly throat of his enemie open ouer him, with his right hand gaue him ſuch a prick, that hee made a déepe wound in his throat whereout did ſpring black bloud and thick red venym in great aboundance: and with his left hand coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himſelfe with his ſhield. The furious ſerpent perceiuing in the ſhield the figure of a goloe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Cock highly eleuated (which naturally he feareth) &amp; ſmelling withall the ſauor of the ſcab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berd which was made of the ſkin of a kinde of Serpent, what with ſuddaine feare, and with the paine he felt of the wound in his throate, he quickly retired himſelf, in ſuch ſort that the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle champion had leaſure to riſe &amp; purſue his enemy, who fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſhield, the Liberian ſcabbard, &amp; the poynt of the ſword which he had felt to the quick, would not caſt himſelfe vnadui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly vpon <hi>Alector,</hi> but began to play againe with his tayle to ſtrike him to the ground. But
<hi>Alector</hi> who once had bin ſtung therewith before; tooke better héed, &amp; euery time that the ſerpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſtroke at him with his taile, hee would nimbly ſpring vp into the ayre, in ſuch ſort that his ſtrokes were imployed in vaine vpon the ſands: which cauſed this dragonlike monſter to chafe in his fury, and with great ire turned his head toward <hi>Alector,</hi> who ſtill put before him the ſhield which he knew to be a feare<pb n="179" facs="tcp:176416:94"/>vnto him: and for that hee ſawe that the blowes of his ſworde would but little preuaile vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his hard ſkin, he thruſt the ſteely poynt of his good ſword ſo firmely into his ſcales, that it ran ſo déep in &amp; pierced ſo rudely, as <hi>Alector</hi> could not pluck it out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: &amp; the ſerpent being a beaſt of merueilous force, in turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelfe with a ſtrong pluck ſnatched it out of his hand. Then new feare aſſailed <hi>Franc-Gal</hi> &amp; al the beholders, loſing the ſhort ioy which they had receiued of the two wounds made in the throate &amp; back of the ſerpent where at bloud &amp; venym iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued moſt aboundantly: &amp; for that they knew not whether they were deadly or not, they remained doubtful betwixt feare and hope. In the meane while the ſerpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t being impatie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous griefe which he felt, turned his head towards his back, and biting with his toeth the hilts of the ſworde whoſe point ſticking faſt gréeued him, ſo much plucked at it, and with force of anger ſo wrong it, alwaies widening &amp; tearing the wound, that at the length he pluckt it out and caſt it on the ſands, not without great loſſe of the moſt part of his téeth. And then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing his enemy vnarmed, he caſt himſelf furiouſly vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him:
<hi>Alector</hi> not hauing any thing wherewith to defend him, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented him his ſhield: &amp; remembring the arrow which hee had ſtuck at his girdle, pulled it out readily and placed it ſo betwéen the iawes, of this wicked beaſt; that he could not ſhut his téeth to gripe the arme of
<hi>Alector,</hi> for the more he ſtroue with it, the faſter it ſtuck: moreouer he found himſelf grieuouſly offended with the body of the arrow which made of Aſſe, being an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexit herian</hi> wood, and naturally contrary to the ſerpents kinde. Wherupon this monſtrous dragon retired in wreathing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe horribly through the great dolor &amp; anguiſh which he felt: not only of the wounds, &amp; arrow; but alſo of the wood therof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wholy againſt his nature &amp; kind, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> plucking out where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he had neither féet nor hands: wherefore he thruſt into his mouth, the end of his taile, which auailed him nothing being ouer féeble and hauing loſt his force by reaſon the ſeale of his back was broken. Whereupon this monſter finding himſelfe thus wounded, ouercharged with the wood and head of the ſhaft contrary to his kinde, affeabled of his force, and his aduerſary nere at hand carrying the Cocke and ſcabbard<pb n="180" facs="tcp:176416:95"/>where were ſo fearefull vnto him, and who againe had recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his ſword, would no more aſſaile him, but retyring himſelf by turning and wreathing as faſt as it was poſſible for him, ſought to enter againe into his Cloaque, which hee could not ſpéedily doo becauſe the breaking of his back hindred his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer legeritie whereby he thought to haue entred his hoale: the which <hi>Alector</hi> ſéeing, and knowing his great aduantage by the crye and brute of the beholders ioyfully clapping their hands, got before, and cut off the way to this flying monſter, by turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his head with great ſtroakes of his ſword vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his iawes and on his taile when he began to reſiſt him with it, ſo ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſo often that by little and little the Serpent began to ware ſo feeble, and his fiercenes ſo to diminiſh, that not able longer to hurt, he ſought wholly to ſlye. In ſuch ſort that the gentle Squire came before him, and without feare thruſt his arme with the ſword ſo far into his throate that it pierced his heart. The ſerpent féeling thereby his deadly wound, began through extreame paine and anguiſh to turne &amp; winde in cruel wiſe.
<hi>Alector</hi> then being ioyfull, and ſéeing his white belly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered which was without ſeales, thruſt in his ſword a foote belowe his throat, and ſo cut it down to his nauell: in ſuch ſort, that with the bloud, venym, fat &amp; inteſtines there iſſued out of the belly of this deuouring ſerpent the body of a man all conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, whome he had but two dayes before ſwallowed downe, the bones onely remayning like an Anotomy, wrapt in ſome paeces of bloudie and filthie clouts. And the ſerpent a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being the terror to a whole towne, who had made ſo many trooked turnes and windings, and giuen ſo many blowes with his venymous taile, and that had eaten ſo many people, being then vanquiſhed, ſlaine, ripped and conſtramed to voyde that which he had deuoured, and all by a young man: did that (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dead) which neuer in his life time he would doo: that is, he ſtretched himſelfe out right like a falue piller, and occupying in his ſo lying a great part of the Sands. <hi>Alector</hi> beholding him in this wiſe began to ſay:
<q rend="inline">"O wicked beaſt when thou canſt no longer harme, thou dooſt that which is right &amp; good. If thou in thy life time haddeſt mainteyned thy ſelfe ſo right, as thou haſt conformed thy ſelf at thy death, ſo many people had not by thée <pb n="181" facs="tcp:176416:95"/>béen deuoured, nor thou ſlaine."</q> And in ſaying ſo, he mounted vpon him with his feete, and trode vpon the head of the dead ſerpent, in ſinging for ioy with a high and clere voyce and face lifted vp to Heauen an <hi>Epinic</hi> ſong of victorie which hee had learned in the Polonian language paſſing through that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, when as the ſpirit of <hi>Gallehault</hi> carried him away: to the great conſolation of the people, &amp; incredible ioy of
<hi>Franc-Gal</hi> his good father. This done he put vp his ſword: and then pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the arrow out of the ſerpents throate: the which he holding in his hand, and viewing it red with the freſh bloud of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and as yet ſtayned with the old bloud of his Lady <hi>Noë<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia</hi> ſlaine, could not but caſt out with a profound ſigh three great teares without wéeping, &amp; theſe words.
<q rend="inline">"O murthering Archer that with this arrowe haſt traiterouſly ſlaine the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent <hi>Noëmia Gratian</hi> the fourth of the Graces before their worthie ſtatues, and betwéene mine armes, and who through an euill conſcience of thy wicked deed dareſt not manifeſt thy ſelf, thinking by occult diſſimulation to eſcape the iuſt venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: I beſeech the Soueraigne God <hi>Ioua,</hi> who in this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple before vs is worſhipped, that the bloud of the innocent which I ſee yet on this arrow, may fall with cruel vengeance vpon thee, that thine iniquitie may deſcend vpon thy head, to the terrible example of al enuious traitors and ſpoylers of the innocent."</q> This ſpoken he darted vp the arrowe into the ayre with ſuch impetuoſitie, &amp; accompanied (as it is credible) with the vertue of ſome ſuperior power, that it mounted with an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakeable legeritie ſo high, that all the aſſiſtants who had their view ſtill towards heauen loſt the ſight thereof, attending when it ſhould fall, longer than an houre with great merueil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And ſeeing it not to fal, they deſcended into the <hi>Arenes</hi> to behold the horrible body of the ſerpent lying vppon the ſands, ſo enormious, hideous and fearefull (albeit hee was dead) that the greater part of the multitude durſt not approach him, but behild him a far of: ſauing onely the vanquiſher
<hi>Alector</hi> which contemplated him in his length, greatnes and terrible forme, armed with impenttrable hardnes, with the deadly venym of ſharp teeth, with catching without letting goe, with a deuour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing throat, &amp; conſuming belly, and with the miſerable remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders<pb n="182" facs="tcp:176416:96"/>of his deuorations. And hereupon conſidered the grace of force and hardines which the Soueraigne had beſtowed vpon him to ouercome ſuch a monſter who hild ſo notable a towne in ſo miſerable a ſubiection: neuertheleſſe hauing ſome doubt of his death and whiles hee ſought very curiouſly on all ſides, behold a voyce iſſuing out of the carren corps of this monſter, ſounding ſo high &amp; great, that it was heard through the whole <hi>Theatre</hi> in theſe words:
<q>
                  <l>Sonne of <hi>Franc-Gal</hi> which now hast ouerthrowne,</l>
                  <l>The reuenger of <hi>Caliſtus</hi> lately ſlaine:</l>
                  <l>To thee full heauie newes, by me is ſhowne</l>
                  <l>That thou ſhalt be tranſformde for this thy paine.</l>
               </q> Theſe ſpéeches being cried high and déepe like the thick ſound of a thunder bolt was heard of all, who ran to ſée what it was, but nothing appeared; for the ſerpent was ſtark dead, and this voyce proceeded not from the beaſt but from ſome ſpirite, to giue aduertiſement or terror to <hi>Alector</hi> of that which was to come: whereto he tooke then no great heede for admiration of this monſter and great ioy of his victory. And thus as the whole multitude were about him and the Serpent in contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, aſtoniſhed at the enormitie of the one and vertue of the other: behold the arrow an houre before darted by him to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Heauen, with a great bruit fell downe from thence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in a flaming fire, cutting the high region with a ſharpe ſounde and lightning, with ſuch impetuoſitie amids the feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full multitude, that it fell vpon the head of a young man na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Coracton</hi> borne in <hi>Orbe</hi> of better houſe than name, who being ſtroken therewith, and attaint with this Celeſtiall fire vnquenchable fell downe to the ground, where through the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable paines and heate wherewith hee felt himſelfe bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, he lay tumbling and groueling in the ſands horriblie cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
<q rend="inline">"<hi>Mercie, mercie Noëmia, Mercie Franck Alector,</hi> for I am the curſed <hi>Coracton</hi> that through malicious enuie and enraged iealoſie haue traiterouſly ſlaine the fayre

So as by this moſt vertuous act he hath reſtored your whole citie to the wonted ſecuritie: for the which all in generall owe him thanks and honour, and not onely to him with vouchſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to accompliſh the meritorious act of ſo great a praiſe: but alſo, to his father, who for vs and the common wealth of this citie hath brought into the World a Sonne of ſuch vertue.

<hi>Franc-Gal</hi> a man moſt vertuous, and thou <hi>Alector</hi> Eſquire moſt valerous, the citie of <hi>Orbe</hi> vniuerſally thanketh you for their wholeſome deliuerance out of the danger and publique euill: in acknowledging whereof the Lords Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrats and all the people do grant vnto you being ſtrangers all the rights and priuileges of this citie, and from henſforth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceine you for cittizens and Patrices of this towne of

<pb n="188" facs="tcp:176416:99"/>the liberator of their citie. In this ſaying he lifted vp the faire and rich crowne and ſet it vpon the head of <hi>Alector,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing it graciouſly with a ſhamefaſt rednes, reſembled to one of <hi>Phoebus</hi> morning beames: his Father <hi>Franc-Gal</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding him ſo affectionatly and fatherly with an extreame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior ioy at the honour wherein hee ſaw his Sonne, (a little before as an offendor condemned) tooke ſuch a ſuddaine ioy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the extreame dolors and deadly feares which hee had not long before conceiued aſwell by his dreames, oracles, viſions, augures, and proper prognoſtications, as alſo of the perill wherein he had ſéen his ſonne vnhoped for in combat with the ſerpent, that his ſoule was almoſt out of himſelfe through the violence of the vnſpeakeable aduentures, diuers encountries, ſuddaine chances vnlooked for, and ſtrange mutations from ſorrow into hope, from hope into trauaile and dolor, from tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel into doubt, from doubt into feare, from feare into vnhoped ioy, and from ioy into incredible admiration: by which diuers contratie, and ſtriuing paſſions being perturbated he reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled a liuing body in a rauiſhed ſoule (as in trueth he was,) ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe ſuch a new ioy ſhined in his merrie vermilion face full of gracious chéerefulnes: that it witneſſed the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure which he receiued of the happy houre, and honour of his crowned ſonne, as already from his infancie he had an euident ſigne. <hi>Alector</hi> then ſéeing him thus repleat with ioy, deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded if the crowne were properly appertaining to him: and it was anſwered yea. Then he lifting it from his owne head, ſet it vpon the head of his Father <hi>Franc-Gal:</hi> who, through ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine mutation (which is perilous and oftentimes deadly) from feare into aſſurance, and from ſorrowe into vnhoped ioy, being alreadie halfe beyond himſelfe, and féeling this ſonnelie pittie to crowne him, through exceſſiue ioy and loue, could no longer kéepe his rauiſhed ſpirit from flying away through ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement exultation: and at the ſame inſtant was ſéene a long, ſtreight and a moſt pure and clere flame iſſuing out of his eyes, and mounting towards heauen through the top of the temple, which in trueth was the light of his cierge put out the laſt day of his peregrination in the temple of the Soueraigne God: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ordinance of the ancient Lady <hi>Anange,</hi> and of<pb n="189" facs="tcp:176416:99"/>her thrée daughters <hi>Cleronome, Zodore,</hi> and <hi>Termaine,</hi> who as then ended the cierge of his life, ſight and way: in ſuch ſort that he remained ſtif, and departed in the ſame habitude of ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and pleaſant face which he had, when (with the extremitie of loue and ioy) the crowne was ſet vpon his head by his dere ſonne <hi>Alector:</hi> in ſuch ſort that none thought he had giuen vp the Ghoſt but onely the good <hi>Croniell</hi> who before had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation of his departure: and who by conferring the viſions and oracles together and vnderſtanding priuatly his ſpeaches doubted the worſt. Wherefore hauing ſignified ſo much to the people, in the preſence of them all he lifted vp his head by the chin calling him thrée times by his name; but it auailed not, for there remained neither life, ſoule, nor ſpirit in him, his Sonne <hi>Alector</hi> more ſorrowful of his fathers death, than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had béen ioyfull of his new glorie, embraced, accolled, kiſſed, called and cried to him, but hee might eaſilie perceiue him to be nothing but a ſtatue of fleſh ſeperated from the ſoule: whereupon through great heauines and ſorrowe which ſtroke him at the heart hee ſwounded in the chayre, in ſuch ſort as it was thought that both Father and Sonne had béen dead, the whole multitude being aſtoniſhed of ſo ſuddaine a mutation from ioy into ſorrow, and from life into death. Neuertheleſſe with the help of thoſe who ſtoode by,
<hi>Alector</hi> came againe to himſelfe beginning with hauty cries to lament his Father, to the great commiſeration of the whole multitude, who thus do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorouſly heard him crie: Alas <hi>Franc-Gal</hi> my Lord &amp; Father, haue you brought mee into this World, to haue no more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with you, but only three dayes at <hi>Tangut</hi> and one onely day at <hi>Orbe?</hi> Alas muſt it chance thus, that hauing tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelled ſo many lands and Seas to ſéeke me who was carried away by the wind, you muſt finde me here in mort all perrill to your griefe, ſuddaine and ſhort ioy, and vnlooked for death? O my moſt dere father, wel haue I attended to be made knight of your haud, for of a more worthie a man I can neuer bee made. Wel I ſée now that if I would be a ſonne any longer, I muſt goe ſéeke another Father: this ſaying hée fell downe againe, neuertheleſſe he was by the Miniſters ſpéedily taken vp, and by the <hi>Archier</hi> conſolated, who ſhowed vnto him the good and<pb n="190" facs="tcp:176416:100"/>long life of <hi>Franc-Gal</hi> his Father, tegether with his happie death in extreame ioy and felicitie, without féele of paine or ſorrowe, his glory of immortall renowne gotten through the whole world, which ſhould redound perpetually to his ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors. For the better manifeſting whereof (tending onely to the end to conſolation) he turned his ſpeach to the people, and by manner of an oration funebrall, hee declared what
<hi>Franc-Gal</hi> was, his noble race, his vertuous acts and déeds, his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions to all vniuerſally (in ripping vp his whole life) and his ſtrange aduentures as he had vnderſtood them of <hi>Franc-Gal</hi> himſelfe and as they haue béen before declared and ſhown. This oration being well vnderſtood, all the people vniuerſally merueiled at ſuch a vertuous and heroycal perſonage, making for him a publique and common mourning from the higheſt Magiſtrate to the loweſt of the poore people: who bore ſuch reuerence to this moſt vertuous deceaſed
<hi>Fran-Gal</hi> that they would not willingly looſe the ſight and preſence of him, nor hide ſo noble a body vnder the earthly darkeneſſes. And therefore by the aduice of all the wiſe men and conſent of all the people, and at the common expence and charges was made a great Tabernacle of moſt fine chriſtall in faſhion of a tower, wherein was encloſed the body of <hi>Franc-Gal,</hi> ſcituated in a chayre, the crowne on his head, in the ſame forme, habitude, and countenance of ioy, that he deceaſed in. In this eſtate they eleuated him vppon foure pillers of guilt braſſe on the north ſide of the Altar, whereby they might alwaies haue him in their ſight as a very Image of vertue: where hee remayned whole in his former beautie for the ſpace of 400. yeares after, vntill ſuch time as the world began to commit Idolatrie to him, wherewithall the Soueraigne
<hi>Ioue</hi> being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>rited, one day hee cauſed it to bee lift vp by foure angelicall ſpirits, and tranſported into ſuch a place, that afterwards it was no more ſéene. Theſe funebrall things being accompliſhed, the next day the <hi>Archier</hi> conducted <hi>Alector</hi> towards the Hauen, where they found
<hi>Franc-Gal</hi> his companie attending their Maſter, to whom
<hi>Alector</hi> (who by them incontinently was knowne and cheriſhed) commanded to diſcharge al the goods being vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the <hi>Hippopotame,</hi> that they might bee conueyed to the<pb n="181" facs="tcp:176416:100"/>towne of
<hi>Orbe.</hi> Which when they had done, hée ſhewed vnto them this ſorrowfull newes, willing them no longer to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend their prince, for that he was dead, where at all of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſtoniſhed demanded of him ſaying: Is <hi>Franc-Gal</hi> dead't And hee anſwered them abſolutely:
<hi>Franc-Gal</hi> is dead. At theſe words <hi>Franc-Gal</hi> is dead, the horſe <hi>Durat Hippopota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me</hi> began to moue (as one hauing vnderſtanding and intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the death of his Maſter) and ſhaked his wings, féete, tayle, head and body with ſuch a violence, that the Sea aroſe round about: and in this torment there iſſued out of the déepe Sea the olde man <hi>Protëus,</hi> who cried aloud, neuer man henſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth ſhall ride vpon thee. In this ſaying he led the horſe into the loftie Stas, where, in the ſight and to the great ſorrow of all the beholders, hee ſonke him in the deapth, in ſuch ſort that neuer after hee was ſeene. The people of <hi>Franc-Gal</hi> ſeeing what had happened, and that they were both without conduct and meanes to ride on the Seas, followed
<hi>Alector</hi> as their Maſter till that they came to <hi>Orbe,</hi> carrying with them the goods and riches of their late Maſter, that they might preſent them to his entire body, and ſée him in his tabernacle: and as they were thus ready to returne, behold a bird paſſing by, came and reſted on the ſhoulders of <hi>Croniell,</hi> who knowing this bird to be ſent him by diuine ordinance, tooke her in his hands, and hauing written in a white leafe theſe verſes:

               </q> He bound it to her neck, commanding her in the name of
